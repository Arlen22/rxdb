# RxDB Database on top of Deno Key Value Store

With the DenoKV [RxStorage](./rx-storage.md) layer for [RxDB](https://rxdb.info), you can run a fully featured NoSQL database on top of the [DenoKV](https://docs.deno.com/kv/manual) storage.


Deno KV is a key-value database built directly into the Deno runtime, available in the Deno.Kv namespace. It can be used for many kinds of data storage use cases, but excels at storing simple data structures that benefit from very fast reads and writes. Deno KV is available in the Deno CLI and on Deno Deploy.
