# Zero Latency Local First Apps with RxDB – Sync, Encryption and Compression

Are you tired of loading spinners and sluggish network calls? The **zero-latency local first** model transforms how your app handles data—storing it locally on the client so that users experience near-instant feedback for every interaction. [RxDB](https://rxdb.info/) (Reactive Database) supercharges this approach, delivering:

- **Local-first storage** that works offline or in low-connectivity environments  
- **Real-time sync** with a remote backend, keeping data updated without manual polling  
- **Encryption** of sensitive data to protect user privacy  
- **Compression** to reduce storage footprints and improve performance  

This article explains how RxDB enables zero-latency local first apps—cutting dependency on remote servers, improving UX, and simplifying your data flow.

## Why Zero Latency with a Local First Approach?

Traditional web or mobile apps make frequent server calls. This often leads to loading screens and slow interactions. A local first approach eliminates these issues:

1. **Instant Feedback**  
   Storing data locally on the device allows write and read operations to happen right away—with no waiting for a remote server. This results in “zero-latency” UI updates.

2. **Offline Functionality**  
   Users can continue creating, editing, or exploring data even in airplane mode or poor network coverage. Changes are stored locally and synchronized later.

3. **Reduced Server Load**  
   Instead of calling the server for every small request, local first apps replicate data once, then update in bulk. This lowers backend resource usage, saving on bandwidth and hosting costs.

4. **Better User Experience**  
   Without the overhead of repeated round trips, your UI feels smooth and continuous, matching the speed of native client applications.

## RxDB: Your Key to Zero-Latency Local First Apps

**RxDB** is a JavaScript NoSQL database that lives inside your client (browser, mobile, desktop). It’s designed to make offline-first apps trivial:

- **NoSQL Document Model** – Store JSON-like documents and query them flexibly.  
- **Reactive Queries** – Subscribe to queries so UI changes automatically on data updates.  
- **Sync Protocol** – Keep local data in sync with your server, complete with conflict handling.  
- **Encryption** – Protect sensitive fields at rest.  
- **Compression** – Reduce data size and improve storage efficiency.

### Example Setup
Below is a basic RxDB flow for a zero-latency local first app:

```ts
import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb/plugins/core';
import { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';
import { replicateRxCollection } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication';

async function initZeroLocalDB() {
  // 1. Create an offline database
  const db = await createRxDatabase({
    name: 'myZeroLocalDB',
    storage: getRxStorageDexie()  // Dexie-based IndexedDB
    // optional: password for encryption
  });

  // 2. Add collections
  await db.addCollections({
    tasks: {
      schema: {
        title: 'task schema',
        version: 0,
        type: 'object',
        primaryKey: 'id',
        properties: {
          id: { type: 'string' },
          title: { type: 'string' },
          done: { type: 'boolean' }
        }
      }
    }
  });

  // 3. Sync your data (optional)
  replicateRxCollection({
    collection: db.tasks,
    replicationIdentifier: 'sync-tasks',
    pull: { /* logic to pull tasks from server */ },
    push: { /* logic to push tasks to server */ },
    live: true // maintain real-time sync
  });

  // 4. Zero-latency queries
  db.tasks
    .find()
    .$ // Observables let your UI auto-update with local data
    .subscribe(allTasks => {
      console.log('Tasks updated:', allTasks);
    });

  return db;
}
```

Now, your application loads tasks instantly from [IndexedDB](../rx-storage-indexeddb.md). If [offline](./offline-database.md), it simply keeps writing data [locally](./local-database.md). When online again, or if your server data changes, RxDB merges the updates automatically.

### Real-Time Sync and Offline-First

When your app starts, RxDB loads data from local storage. If the user goes offline, they continue to read/write as normal—**zero-latency**. Once back online, RxDB’s [replication protocol](../replication.md) automatically **pushes** local changes to the server and **pulls** any remote updates.

**Many sync options** exist:
- **CouchDB** or **PouchDB**  
- **Firestore**  
- **GraphQL**  
- **HTTP / REST**  
- **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer setups  

Your local state never becomes stale because RxDB merges new data on the fly.

### Built-In Encryption for Security

Worried about storing sensitive info on the device? RxDB offers [encryption plugins](../encryption.html) to secure any fields you mark as “encrypted.” If the device is stolen, the data on disk remains protected unless someone knows the password or key.

#### Encryption Example

```ts
import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb/plugins/core';
import { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';
import { wrappedKeyEncryptionCryptoJsStorage } from 'rxdb/plugins/encryption-crypto-js';

async function initSecureDB() {
  // Wrap Dexie storage with AES-based encryption
  const encryptedStorage = wrappedKeyEncryptionCryptoJsStorage({
    storage: getRxStorageDexie()
  });

  // Create database with a password
  const db = await createRxDatabase({
    name: 'zeroLocalFirstDB',
    storage: encryptedStorage,
    password: 'mySuperSecretPassword'
  });

  // Define a collection with an encrypted field
  await db.addCollections({
    userInfo: {
      schema: {
        title: 'secured user schema',
        version: 0,
        type: 'object',
        primaryKey: 'id',
        properties: {
          id: { type: 'string' },
          personalData: { type: 'string' }
        },
        required: ['id'],
        encrypted: ['personalData']
      }
    }
  });

  return db;
}
```





### Compression for Leaner Storage

Large documents and repeated fields can bloat your local storage usage. RxDB’s [key compression](../key-compression.md) shrinks field names internally, significantly reducing data size at rest and in transit. This yields to decreased persistent storage overhead.

By simply enabling `keyCompression: true` in your schema, you can keep your zero-latency local first approach running smoothly on resource-constrained devices.

```ts
await db.addCollections({
  products: {
    schema: {
      title: 'products schema',
      version: 0,
      keyCompression: true, // compress field names internally
      type: 'object',
      primaryKey: 'id',
      properties: {
        id: { type: 'string' },
        name: { type: 'string' },
        description: { type: 'string' },
        price: { type: 'number' }
      }
    }
  }
});
```
