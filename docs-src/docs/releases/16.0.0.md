# 16.0.0

The release [16.0.0](https://rxdb.info/releases/16.0.0.html) is used for major refactorings. We did not change that much, mostly renaming things and fixing confusing implementation details.

Data stored in the previous version `15` is be compatible with the code of the new version `16` for most RxStorage implementation. So migration will be easy. Only with the node-filesystem RxStorage and the OPFS RxStorage it is required to migrate the data itself with the [storage migration plugin](../migration-storage.md).

## Breaking Changes
- CHANGE [RxServer](https://rxdb.info/rx-server.html) is no longer in beta mode.
- CHANGE [Fulltext Search](https://rxdb.info/fulltext-search.html) is no longer in beta mode.
- CHANGE [Custom Reactivity](https://rxdb.info/reactivity.html) is no longer in beta mode.
- CHANGE [initialCheckpoint in replicationss](https://rxdb.info/replication.html) is no longer in beta mode.
- CHANGE [RxState](https://rxdb.info/rx-state.html) is no longer in beta mode.
- CHANGE [MemoryMapped RxStorage](https://rxdb.info/rx-storage-memory-mapped.html) is no longer in beta mode.

- CHANGE rename `randomCouchString()` to `randomToken()`
- CHANGE Split conflict handler functionality into `isEqual()` and `resolve()`.
- FIX (GraphQL replication) datapath must be equivalent for pull and push [#6019](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/pull/6019)
- CHANGE `ignoreDuplicate: true` on `createRxDatabase()` must only be allowed in dev-mode.
- RENAME 
  - `.destroy()` to `.close()`
  - `.onDestroy()` to `.onClose()`
  - `postDestroyRxCollection` to `postCloseRxCollection`
  - `preDestroyRxDatabase` to `preCloseRxDatabase`
- CHANGE when dev-mode is enabled, a schema validator must be used.
- REMOVED the deprecated LokiJS RxStorage.

- REMOVE fallback to the `ohash` package when `crypto.subtle` does not exist. All modern runtimes (also react-native) now support `crypto.subtle`, so we do not need that fallback anymore.

## Internal Changes

- CHANGE (internal) migration-storage plugin: Remove catch from cleanup
- CHANGE (internal) rename RX_PIPELINE_CHECKPOINT_CONTEXT to `rx-pipeline-checkpoint`
- CHANGE (internal) remove `conflictResultionTasks()` and `resolveConflictResultionTask()` from the RxStorage interface.
- REMOVED (internal) do not check for duplicate event bulks, all RxStorage implementations must guarantee to not emit the same events twice.
- REFACTOR (internal) Only use event-bulks internally and only transform to single emitted events if actually someone has subscribed to the eventstream.

## Bugfixes

- Having a lot of documents pulled in the replication could in some cases slow down the database initialization because `upstreamInitialSync()` did not set a checkpoint and each time checked all documents if they are equal to the master.


## Minor things

- Moved RxQuery checks into dev-mode.
- RxQuery.remove() now internally does a bulk operation for better performance.
- Lazily process bulkWrite() results for less CPU usage.
- Only run interval cleanup on the storage of a collection if there actually have been writes to it.

## You can help!

There are many things that can be done by **you** to improve RxDB:

- Check the [BACKLOG](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/blob/master/orga/BACKLOG.md) for features that would be great to have.
- Check the [breaking backlog](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/blob/master/orga/before-next-major.md) for breaking changes that must be implemented in the future but where I did not have the time yet.
- Check the [TODOs](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/search?q=TODO) in the code. There are many small improvements that can be done for performance and build size.
- Review the code and add tests. I am only a single human with a laptop. My code is not perfect and much small improvements can be done when people review the code and help me to clarify undefined behaviors.
- Update the [example projects](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/tree/master/examples) some of them are outdated and need updates.
