## Replication

- Replication options (like url), are no longer used as replication state identifier.
Changing the url without having to restart the replication, is now possible.

## Use `crypto.subtle.digest` for hashing

Using `crypto.subtle.digest` from the native WebCrypto API is much faster. If the API is not available, like in React-Native, the [ohash](https://github.com/unjs/ohash) module is used instead.

## Fix attachment hashing

Hashing of attachment data to calculate the `digest` is now done from the RxDB side, not the RxStorage. If you set a custom `hashFunction` for the database, it will also be used for attachments.
## Requires at least typescript version 5.0.0

We now use `export type * from './types';`

## Memory RxStorage

- Writes are 3x faster
- Find-by id is 2x faster
