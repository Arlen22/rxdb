## Fix attachment hashing

Hashing of attachment data to calculate the `digest` is now done from the RxDB side, not the RxStorage. If you set a custom `hashFunction` for the database, it will also be used for attachments.
## Requires at least typescript version 5.0.0

We now use `export type * from './types';`

## Memory RxStorage

- Writes are 3x faster
- Find-by id is 2x faster
