# Premium Tasks

If you are a **single developer** and you use RxDB in your **side project**, you can get free 2 years access to the [RxDB Premium](https://rxdb.info/premium) package by solving one Task of this list. Before you start working on that task, please make an issue where you tell about the estimated time to finish the task.


## Open Tasks

- Update **all** [open PRs from the renovate bot](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+by%3A%40renovate) and ensure that the CI is green.
