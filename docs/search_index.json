SUMMARY.md\n"},"quickstart.html":{"url":"quickstart.html","title":"Quickstart","keywords":"","body":"RxDB Quickstart\nWelcome to the RxDB Quickstart. In a few minutes you will be shown how to create a simple realtime TODO-app with RxDB.\nInstallation\nRxDB is distributed via npm and can be installed with the command:\nnpm install rxdb\nRxDB uses the rxjs library as peerDependency which must also be installed:\nnpm install rxjs\nEnable dev-mode\nWhen you use RxDB in development mode, you should enable the dev-mode plugin which adds helpful checks and validations to RxDB and tells you if you do something wrong.\nimport { addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\nimport { RxDBDevModePlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/dev-mode';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBDevModePlugin);\n\nCreate a RxDatabase\nChoose a RxStorage\nRxDB can be used in different JavaScript runtimes which have different methods to store persistend data. Depending on the runtime, a different RxStorage must be used. For browser applications it is recommended to start with the Dexie.js RxStorage which comes directly with the RxDB npm package.\nimport { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';\n\nCreate the RxDatabase\nWith the storage and a picked database name, you can now create the RxDatabase instance:\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb';\nimport { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';\n\nconst myDatabase = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'mydatabase',\n  storage: getRxStorageDexie()\n});\n\nCreate a RxCollection\nOn top of the RxDatabase, you can add any amount of collections. A RxCollection can then be used to store and query the actual documents.\nCreate a schema for a collection\nRxDB requires a json schema for each collection that defines how the stored documents of that collection look like.\nFor the example app, we create a simple schema that stores todo-document:\nconst mySchema = {\n    version: 0,\n    primaryKey: 'id',\n    type: 'object',\n    properties: {\n        id: {\n            type: 'string',\n            maxLength: 100 // \nAdd a RxCollection to the RxDatabase\nWith that schema we can now add the todos collection to the database:\nawait myDatabase.addCollections({\n  todos: {\n    schema: mySchema\n  }\n});\n\nWrite Operations\nNow that we have a RxCollection, we can store some documents in it.\nInsert a document\nconst myDocument = await myDatabase.todos.insert({\n    id: 'todo1',\n    name: 'Learn RxDB',\n    done: false,\n    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()\n});\n\nUpdate a document\nThere are multiple ways to update a RxDocument. The simplest one is the modify method that takes a plain JavaScript function\nwhich mutates the document state and returns the mutated version.\nawait myDocument.modify(docData => {\n    docData.done = true;\n    return docData;\n});\n\nFor the other methods to change a documents data, see here\nDelete a document\nDelete a RxDocument by calling myDocument.remove(). This will set the documents state to DELETED which ensures that it will be no longer found in query results. RxDB stores even deleted documents so that it is able to sync the deleted state to other instances during replication. The deleted document will be purged in a later point in time with the cleanup plugin.\nQuery Operations\nNormal Query\nLike many NoSQL databases, RxDB uses the Mango syntax for query operations.\nTo run a query, you first create an RxQuery object with myCollection.find() and then call .exec() on that object to fetch the query results.\nconst foundDocuments = await myDatabase.todos.find({\n    selector: {\n        done: {\n            $eq: false\n        }\n    }\n}).exec();\n\nOther examples for the Mango Query syntax can be found here.\nIn addition to the .find() RxQuery, RxDB has additional query objects that can be used to find the desired documents:\n\nfindOne()\nfindByIds()\n\nObserving data\nWhen you build a modern realtime application with RxDB, you do not only need data once, but instead you might want to subscribe to the data so that your UI is always up-to-date with the data stored on disc.\nRxDB allows to subscribe to data which is then updated even when it was changed in an other part of your application, an other browser tab or by the replication.\nObserving queries\nTo observe a query, instead of calling .exec() you get the observable of the RxQuery object via .$ and then subscribe to it.\nconst observable = myDatabase.todos.find({\n    selector: {\n        done: {\n            $eq: false\n        }\n    }\n}).$;\nobservable.subscribe(allNonDoneTodos => {\n    console.log('Currently have ' + allNonDoneTodos.length + 'things to do');\n});\n\nSubscribe to a document value\nIn addition to queries, you can also subscribe to the fields of a single RxDocument. Therefore you add the $ sign to the desired field and then subscribe to the returned observable.\nmyDocument.done$.subscribe(isDone => {\n    console.log('done: ' + isDone);\n});\n\nFollow Up\nYou are now prepared to dive deeper into RxDB. If you have any questions, you can ask the community at the RxDB Chat. Also do not forget to leave a star at the RxDB github repository.\n"},"install.html":{"url":"install.html","title":"Install","keywords":"","body":"Install\nnpm\nTo install the latest release of rxdb and its dependencies and save it to your package.json, run:\nnpm i rxdb --save\npeer-dependency\nYou also need to install the peer-dependency rxjs if you have not installed it before.\nnpm i rxjs --save\npolyfills\nRxDB is coded with es8 and transpiled to es5.

It has the following parameters:\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb';\nimport { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';\n\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'heroesdb',                   // \nname\nThe database-name is a string which uniquely identifies the database. When two RxDatabases have the same name and use the same RxStorage, their data can be assumed as equal and they will share events between each other.\nDepending on the storage or adapter this can also be used to define the filesystem folder of your data.\nstorage\nRxDB works on top of an implementation of the RxStorage interface. This interface is an abstraction that allows you to use different underlying databases that actually handle the documents. Depending on your use case you might use a different storage with different tradeoffs in performance, bundle size or supported runtimes.\nThere are many RxStorage implementations that can be used depending on the JavaScript environment and performance requirements.\nFor example you can use the Dexie RxStorage in the browser or use the LokiJS storage with the filesystem adapter in Node.js.\n\nList of RxStorage implementations\n\n\n// use the Dexie.js RxStorage that stores data in IndexedDB.\nimport { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';\n\nconst dbDexie = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'mydatabase',\n  storage: getRxStorageDexie()\n});\n\n\n// ...or use the LokiJS RxStorage with the indexeddb adapter.\nimport { getRxStorageLoki } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-lokijs';\nconst LokiIncrementalIndexedDBAdapter = require('lokijs/src/incremental-indexeddb-adapter');\n\nconst dbLoki = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'mydatabase',\n  storage: getRxStorageLoki({\n    adapter: new LokiIncrementalIndexedDBAdapter()\n  })\n});\n\npassword\n(optional)\nIf you want to use encrypted fields in the collections of a database, you have to set a password for it. The password must be a string with at least 12 characters.\nRead more about encryption here.\nmultiInstance\n(optional=true)\nWhen you create more than one instance of the same database in a single javascript-runtime, you should set multiInstance to true. This will enable the event sharing between the two instances. For example when the user has opened multiple browser windows, events will be shared between them so that both windows react to the same changes.\nmultiInstance should be set to false when you have single-instances like a single Node.js-process, a react-native-app, a cordova-app or a single-window electron app which can decrease the startup time because no instance coordination has to be done.\neventReduce\n(optional=false)\nOne big benefit of having a realtime database is that big performance optimizations can be done when the database knows a query is observed and the updated results are needed continuously. RxDB uses the EventReduce Algorithm to optimize observer or recurring queries.\nFor better performance, you should always set eventReduce: true. This will also be the default in the next major RxDB version.\nignoreDuplicate\n(optional=false)\nIf you create multiple RxDatabase-instances with the same name and same adapter, it's very likely that you have done something wrong.\nTo prevent this common mistake, RxDB will throw an error when you do this.\nIn some rare cases like unit-tests, you want to do this intentional by setting ignoreDuplicate to true.\nconst db1 = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'heroesdb',\n  storage: getRxStorageDexie(),\n  ignoreDuplicate: true\n});\nconst db2 = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'heroesdb',\n  storage: getRxStorageDexie(),\n  ignoreDuplicate: true // this create-call will not throw because you explicitly allow it\n});\n\nMethods\nObserve with $\nCalling this will return an rxjs-Observable which streams all write events of the RxDatabase.\nmyDb.$.subscribe(changeEvent => console.dir(changeEvent));\n\nexportJSON()\nUse this function to create a json-export from every piece of data in every collection of this database. You can pass true as a parameter to decrypt the encrypted data-fields of your document.\nBefore exportJSON() and importJSON() can be used, you have to add the json-dump plugin.\nimport { addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\nimport { RxDBJsonDumpPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/json-dump';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBJsonDumpPlugin);\n\nmyDatabase.exportJSON()\n  .then(json => console.dir(json));\n\nimportJSON()\nTo import the json-dumps into your database, use this function.\n// import the dump to the database\nemptyDatabase.importJSON(json)\n  .then(() => console.log('done'));\n\nbackup()\nWrites the current (or ongoing) database state to the filesystem.

Some RxStorages allow to use boolean fields as index.\nDepending on the field type, you must have set some meta attributes like maxLength or minimum. This is required so that RxDB\nis able to know the maximum string representation length of a field, which is needed to craft custom indexes on several RxStorage implementations.\nNOTICE: RxDB will always append the primaryKey to all indexes to ensure a deterministic sort order of query results. You do not have to add the primaryKey to any index.\nIndex-example\nconst schemaWithIndexes = {\n  version: 0,\n  title: 'human schema with indexes',\n  keyCompression: true,\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string',\n          maxLength: 100 // \nattachments\nTo use attachments in the collection, you have to add the attachments-attribute to the schema. See RxAttachment.\ndefault\nDefault values can only be defined for first-level fields.\nWhenever you insert a document unset fields will be filled with default-values.\nconst schemaWithDefaultAge = {\n  version: 0,\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string',\n          maxLength: 100 // \nfinal\nBy setting a field to final, you make sure it cannot be modified later. Final fields are always required.\nFinal fields cannot be observed because they will not change.\nAdvantages:\n\nWith final fields you can ensure that no-one accidentally modifies the data.\nWhen you enable the eventReduce algorithm, some performance-improvements are done.\n\nconst schemaWithFinalAge = {\n  version: 0,\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string',\n          maxLength: 100 // \nNOTICE: Not everything within the jsonschema-spec is allowed\nThe schema is not only used to validate objects before they are written into the database, but also used to map getters to observe and populate single fieldnames, keycompression and other things. Therefore you can not use every schema which would be valid for the spec of json-schema.org.\nFor example, fieldnames must match the regex ^[a-zA-Z][[a-zA-Z0-9_]*]?[a-zA-Z0-9]$ and additionalProperties is always set to false. But don't worry, RxDB will instantly throw an error when you pass an invalid schema into it.\n"},"schema-validation.html":{"url":"schema-validation.html","title":"Schema Validation","keywords":"","body":"Schema validation\nRxDB has multiple validation implementations that can be used to ensure that your document data is always matching the provided JSON \nschema of your RxCollection.\nThe schema validation is not a plugin but comes in as a wrapper around any other RxStorage and it will then validate all data that is written into that storage. This is required for multiple reasons:\n\nIt allows us to run the validation inside of a Worker RxStorage instead of running it in the main JavaScript process.\nIt allows us to configure which RxDatabase instance must use the validation and which does not. In production it often makes sense to validate user data, but you might not need the validation for data that is only replicated from the backend.\n\nNOTICE: Schema validation can be CPU expensive and increases your build size. You should always use a schema validation in development mode. For most use cases, you should not use a validation in production for better performance.\nWhen no validation is used, any document data can be saved but there might be undefined behavior when saving data that does not comply to the schema of a RxCollection.\nRxDB has different implementations to validate data, each of them is based on a different JSON Schema library. In this example we use the Dexie.js RxStorage, but you can wrap the validation around any other RxStorage.\nvalidate-ajv\nA validation-module that does the schema-validation.

Also the call to bulkInsert() it will not throw if a single document errors because of validation errors. Instead it will return the error in the .error property of the returned object.\nbulkRemove()\nWhen you want to remove many documents at once, use bulk remove.

Therefore it is not possible to run a count() query with a selector that requires to fetch and compare the document data. So if your query selector does not fully match an index of the schema, it is not allowed to run it. These queries would have no performance benefit compared to normal queries but have the tradeoff of not using the fetched document data for caching.\n/**\n * The following will throw an error because\n * the count operation cannot run on any specific index range\n * because the $regex operator is used.\n */\nconst query = myCollection.count({\n  selector: {\n    age: {\n      $regex: 'foobar'\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n/**\n * The following will throw an error because\n * the count operation cannot run on any specific index range\n * because there is no ['age' ,'otherNumber'] index\n * defined in the schema.\n */\nconst query = myCollection.count({\n  selector: {\n    age: {\n      $gt: 20\n    },\n    otherNumber: {\n      $gt: 10\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nIf you want to count these kind of queries, you should do a normal query instead and use the length of the result set as counter. This has the same performance as running a non-fully-indexed count which has to fetch all document data from the database and run a query matcher.\n// get count manually once\nconst resultSet = await myCollection.find({\n  selector: {\n    age: {\n      $regex: 'foobar'\n    }\n  }\n}).exec();\nconst count = resultSet.length;\n\n// observe count manually\nconst count$ = myCollection.find({\n  selector: {\n    age: {\n      $regex: 'foobar'\n    }\n  }\n}).$.pipe(\n  map(result => result.length)\n);\n\n/**\n * To allow non-fully-indexed count queries,\n * you can also specify that by setting allowSlowCount=true\n * when creating the database.\n */\nconst database = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    allowSlowCount: true, // set this to true [default=false]\n    /* ... */\n});\n\nallowSlowCount\nTo allow non-fully-indexed count queries, you can also specify that by setting allowSlowCount: true when creating the database.\nDoing this is mostly not wanted, because it would run the counting on the storage without having the document stored in the RxDB document cache.\nThis is only recommended if the RxStorage is running remotely like in a WebWorker and you not always want to send the document-data between the worker and the main thread. In this case you might only need the count-result instead to save performance.\nNOTICE: RxDB will always append the primary key to the sort parameters\nFor several performance optimizations, like the EventReduce algorithm, RxDB expects all queries to return a deterministic sort order that does not depend on the insert order of the documents. To ensure a deterministic ordering, RxDB will always append the primary key as last sort parameter to all queries and to all indexes.\nThis works in contrast to most other databases where a query without sorting would return the documents in the order in which they had been inserted to the database.\nNOTICE: RxQuery's are immutable\nBecause RxDB is a reactive database, we can do heavy performance-optimisation on query-results which change over time. To be able to do this, RxQuery's have to be immutable.\nThis means, when you have a RxQuery and run a .where() on it, the original RxQuery-Object is not changed. Instead the where-function returns a new RxQuery-Object with the changed where-field. Keep this in mind if you create RxQuery's and change them afterwards.\nExample:\nconst queryObject = myCollection.find().where('age').gt(18);\n// Creates a new RxQuery object, does not modify previous one\nqueryObject.sort('name');\nconst results = await queryObject.exec();\nconsole.dir(results); // result-documents are not sorted by name\n\nconst queryObjectSort = queryObject.sort('name');\nconst results = await queryObjectSort.exec();\nconsole.dir(results); // result-documents are now sorted\n\nisRxQuery\nReturns true if the given object is an instance of RxQuery. Returns false if not.\nconst is = isRxQuery(myObj);\n\n"},"rx-storage.html":{"url":"rx-storage.html","title":"RxStorage","keywords":"","body":"RxStorage\nRxDB is not a self contained database.

In difference to a server side database, RxDB is bound to the limits of the JavaScript runtime. For example in the browser it is only possible to store data in a slow IndexedDB instead of a filesystem.\nLokiJS stores all data in memory and only saves to disc occasionally (or on exit). Therefore it has a very fast read/write performance, but loading all data into memory on the first page load can take longer for big amounts of documents. Also this storage can only be used when all data fits into the memory at least once.\nThe Premium sharding RxStorage is only useful when big amounts of documents have to be stored or queries. In the CI performance test, we only insert a small amount of documents so that the performance actually decreases when sharding is used.\nMany storages run lazy, so it makes no sense to compare the time which is required to create a database with collections.

It can do this because it is an in-memory database that processes all data in memory and only saves to disc when the app is closed or an interval is reached.\nWARNING: The LokiJS project itself is no longer in development or maintained. Bugs that occur outside of the RxDB layer will likely not be fixed. It is recommended to use another RxStorage instead.\nPros\n\nQueries can run faster because all data is processed in memory.\nIt has a much faster initial load time because it loads all data from IndexedDB in a single request.

For LokiJS there are adapters for IndexedDB, AWS S3, the NodeJS filesystem or NativeScript.\nFind more about the possible adapters at the LokiJS docs.\nMulti-Tab support\nWhen you use plain LokiJS, you cannot build an app that can be used in multiple browser tabs. The reason is that LokiJS loads data in bulk and then only regularly persists the in-memory state to disc. When opened in multiple tabs, it would happen that the LokiJS instances overwrite each other and data is lost.\nWith the RxDB LokiJS-plugin, this problem is fixed with the LeaderElection module. Between all open tabs, a leading tab is elected and only in this tab a database is created. All other tabs do not run queries against their own database, but instead call the leading tab to send and retrieve data. When the leading tab is closed, a new leader is elected that reopens the database and processes queries. You can disable this by setting multiInstance: false when creating the RxDatabase.\nAutosave and autoload\nWhen using plain LokiJS, you could set the autosave option to true to make sure that LokiJS persists the database state after each write into the persistence adapter. Same goes to autoload which loads the persisted state on database creation.\nBut RxDB knows better when to persist the database state and when to load it, so it has its own autosave logic. This will ensure that running the persistence handler does not affect the performance of more important tasks. Instead RxDB will always wait until the database is idle and then runs the persistence handler.\nA load of the persisted state is done on database or collection creation and it is ensured that multiple load calls do not run in parallel and interfere with each other or with saveDatabase() calls.\nKnown problems\nWhen you bundle the LokiJS Plugin with webpack, you might get the error Cannot find module \"fs\". This is because LokiJS uses a require('fs') statement that cannot work in the browser.\nYou can fix that by telling webpack to not resolve the fs module with the following block in your webpack config:\n// in your webpack.config.js\n{\n    /* ... */\n    resolve: {\n        fallback: {\n            fs: false\n        }\n    }\n    /* ... */\n}\n\n// Or if you do not have a webpack.config.js like you do with angular,\n// you might fix it by setting the browser field in the package.json\n{\n  /* ... */\n  \"browser\": {\n    \"fs\": false\n  }\n  /* ... */\n}\n\nUsing the internal LokiJS database\nFor custom operations, you can access the internal LokiJS database.\nThis is dangerous because you might do changes that are not compatible with RxDB.\nOnly use this when there is no way to achieve your goals via the RxDB API.\n\nconst storageInstance = myRxCollection.storageInstance;\nconst localState = await storageInstance.internals.localState;\nlocalState.collection.insert({\n    key: 'foo',\n    value: 'bar',\n    _deleted: false,\n    _attachments: {},\n    _rev: '1-62080c42d471e3d2625e49dcca3b8e3e',\n    _meta: {\n        lwt: new Date().getTime()\n    }\n});\n\n// manually trigger the save queue because we did a write to the internal loki db. \nawait localState.databaseState.saveQueue.addWrite();\n\n"},"rx-storage-memory.html":{"url":"rx-storage-memory.html","title":"RxStorage Memory","keywords":"","body":"Memory RxStorage\n\nThe Memory RxStorage is based on plain in memory arrays and objects.

Compared to other storage solutions, it has a way better performance.\nWhat is OPFS\nThe Origin Private File System (OPFS) is a native browser storage API that allows web applications to manage files in a private, sandboxed, origin-specific virtual filesystem. Unlike IndexedDB and LocalStorage, which are optimized as object/key-value storage, OPFS provides more granular control for file operations, enabling byte-by-byte access, file streaming, and even low-level manipulations. \nOPFS is ideal for applications requiring high-performance file operations (3x-4x faster compared to IndexedDB) inside of a client-side application, offering advantages like improved speed, more efficient use of resources, and enhanced security and privacy features.\nOPFS limitations\nFrom the beginning of 2023, the Origin Private File System API is supported by all modern browsers like Safari, Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Only Internet Explorer is not supported and likely will never get support.\nIt is important to know that the OPFS API is only available inside of a WebWorker.\nIt cannot be used in the main thread, an iFrame or even a SharedWorker.\nIf you call the OPFS getFileHandle() function in the main thread, it will throw the error Uncaught DOMException: A requested file or directory could not be found at the time an operation was processed..\nWhile there is no concrete data size limit defined by the API, browsers will refuse to store more data at some point.\nIf no more data can be written, a QuotaExceededError is thrown which should be handled by the application, like showing an error message to the user.\nHow the OPFS API works\nThe OPFS API is pretty straigtforward to use. First you get the root filesystem. Then you can create files and directory on that. Notice that whenever you writ to, or read from a file, an ArrayBuffer must be used that contains the data. It is not possible to write plain strings or objects into the file. Therefore the TextEncoder and TextDecoder API must be used.\nAlso notice that the methods of FileSystemSyncAccessHandle have been asynchronous in the past, but are synchronous since Chromium 108. To make it less confusing, we just use await in front of them, so it will work in both cases.\n// Access the root directory of the origin's private file system\nconst root = await navigator.storage.getDirectory();\n\n// create a subdirectory\nconst diaryDirectory = await root.getDirectoryHandle('subfolder', { create : true });\n\n// Create a new file named 'example.txt'\nconst fileHandle = await diaryDirectory.getFileHandle('example.txt', { create: true });\n\n// Create a FileSystemSyncAccessHandle on the file.\nconst accessHandle = await draftFile.createSyncAccessHandle();\n\n// Get the size of the file.\nconst fileSize = accessHandle.getSize();\n\n// read file and transform data to string\nconst fileSize = await accessHandle.getSize();\nconst readBuffer = new Uint8Array(fileSize);\nawait accessHandle.read(readBuffer, { at: 0 });\nconst contentAsString = new TextDecoder().decode(readBuffer);\n\n// Write a sentence to the end of the file.\nconst writeBuffer = new TextEncoder().encode('Hello from RxDB');\nconst writeSize = await accessHandle.write(writeBuffer, { \"at\" : readSize });\n\n// Truncate file to 10 bytes.\nawait accessHandle.truncate(10);\n\n// Persist changes to disk.\nawait accessHandle.flush();\n\n// Always close FileSystemSyncAccessHandle if done, so others can open the file again.\nawait accessHandle.close();\n\nAre more detailed description of the OPFS API can be found on mdn here.\nOPFS performance\nBecause the Origin Private File System API provides low-level access to binary files, it is much faster compared to IndexedDB or localStorage. According to the storage performance test, OPFS is up to 2x times faster on plain inserts when a new file is created on each write. Reads are even faster.\nA good comparison about real world scenarios, are the performance results of the various RxDB storages. Here it shows that reads are up to 4x faster compared to IndexedDB, even with complex queries:\n\n  \n\n\n\nUsing OPFS as RxStorage in RxDB\nThe OPFS RxStorage itself must run inside a WebWorker. Therefore we use the Worker RxStorage and let it point to the prebuild opfs.worker.js file that comes shipped with RxDB Premium.\nNotice that the OPFS RxStorage is part of the RxDB Premium plugin that must be purchased.\nAlso is in beta mode at the moment which means it can include breaking changes without a RxDB major version increment.\nimport {\n    createRxDatabase\n} from 'rxdb';\nimport { getRxStorageWorker } from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-worker';\nimport { RxStorageOPFSStatics } from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-opfs';\n\nconst database = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    storage: getRxStorageWorker(\n        {\n            statics: RxStorageOPFSStatics,\n            /**\n             * This file must be statically served from a webserver.\n             * You might want to first copy it somewhere outside of\n             * your node_modules folder.\n             */\n            workerInput: 'node_modules/rxdb-premium/dist/workers/opfs.worker.js'\n        }\n    )\n});\n\nBuilding a custom worker.js\nWhen you want to run additional plugins like storage wrappers or replication inside of the worker, you have to build your own worker.js file. You can do that similar to other workers by calling exposeWorkerRxStorage like described in the worker storage plugin.\n// inside of worker.js\nimport { getRxStorageOPFS } from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-opfs';\nimport { exposeWorkerRxStorage } from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-worker';\n\nconst storage = getRxStorageOPFS();\nexposeWorkerRxStorage({\n    storage\n});\n\nOPFS in Electron, React-Native or Capacitor.js\nOrigin Private File System is a browser API that is only accessible in browsers. Other JavaScript like React-Native or Node.js, do not support it.\nElectron has two JavaScript contexts: the browser (chromium) context and the Node.js context. While you could use the OPFS API in the browser context, it is not recommended. Instead you should use the Filesystem API of Node.js and then only transfer the relevant data with the ipcRenderer. With RxDB that is pretty easy to configure:\n\nIn the main.js, expose the Node Filesystem storage with the exposeIpcMainRxStorage() that comes with the electron plugin\nIn the browser context, access the main storage with the getRxStorageIpcRenderer() method.\n\nReact Native (and Expo) does not have an OPFS API. You could use the ReactNative Filesystem to directly write data. But to get a fully featured database like RxDB it is easier to use the SQLite RxStorage which starts an SQLite database inside of the ReactNative app and uses that to do the database operations.\nCapacitor.js is able to access the OPFS API.\nDifference between File System Access API and Origin Private File System (OPFS)\nOften developers are confused with the differences between the File System Access API and the Origin Private File System (OPFS).\n\nThe File System API provides access to the files on the device file system, like the ones shown in the file explorer of the operating system. To use the ile System API, the user has to actively select the files from a filepicker.\nOrigin Private File System (OPFS) is a sub-part of the File System API and it only describes the things you can do with the filesystem root from navigator.storage.getDirectory(). OPFS writes to a sandboxed filesystem, not visible to the user. Therefore the user does not have to actively select or allow the data access. \n\nLearn more about OPFS:\n\nWebKit: The File System API with Origin Private File System\nBrowser Support\nPerformance Test Tool\n\n"},"rx-storage-sqlite.html":{"url":"rx-storage-sqlite.html","title":"RxStorage SQLite","keywords":"","body":"SQLite RxStorage\nThis RxStorage is based on SQLite and is made to work with Node.js, Electron, React Native, Cordova and Capacitor.\nPros\n\nFast\nSmall build size\n\nCons\n\nIt is part of RxDB Premium\n\nRequirements\nThe SQlite RxStorage works on SQLite libraries that use SQLite in version 3.38.0 or higher, because it uses the SQLite JSON methods like JSON_EXTRACT.

It is not part of the default RxDB module.\nUsage\nOn the SharedWorker process\nIn the worker process JavaScript file, you have wrap the original RxStorage with getRxStorageIndexedDB().\n// shared-worker.ts\n\nimport { exposeWorkerRxStorage } from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-worker';\nimport { \n    getRxStorageIndexedDB,\n    RxStorageIndexedDBStatics\n} from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/indexeddb';\n\nexposeWorkerRxStorage({\n    /**\n     * You can wrap any implementation of the RxStorage interface\n     * into a worker.\n     * Here we use the IndexedDB RxStorage.\n     */\n    storage: getRxStorageIndexedDB()\n});\n\nOn the main process\nimport {\n    createRxDatabase\n} from 'rxdb';\nimport { getRxStorageSharedWorker } from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-worker';\nimport { getRxStorageIndexedDB } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-indexeddb';\n\n\nconst database = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    storage: getRxStorageSharedWorker(\n        {\n            /**\n             * The static methods of the RxStorage that is also\n             * used inside of the SharedWorker process.\n             */\n            statics: RxStorageIndexedDBStatics,\n            /**\n             * Contains any value that can be used as parameter\n             * to the SharedWorker constructor of thread.js\n             * Most likely you want to put the path to the shared-worker.js file in here.\n             * \n             * @link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker?retiredLocale=de\n             */\n            workerInput: 'path/to/shared-worker.js',\n            /**\n             * (Optional) options\n             * for the worker.\n             */\n            workerOptions: {\n                type: 'module',\n                credentials: 'omit'\n            }\n        }\n    )\n});\n\nPre-build workers\nThe shared-worker.js must be a self containing JavaScript file that contains all dependencies in a bundle.\nTo make it easier for you, RxDB ships with pre-bundles worker files that are ready to use.\nYou can find them in the folder node_modules/rxdb-premium/dist/workers after you have installed the RxDB Premium Plugin. From there you can copy them to a location where it can be served from the webserver and then use their path to create the RxDatabase\nAny valid worker.js JavaScript file can be used both, for normal Workers and SharedWorkers.\nimport {\n    createRxDatabase\n} from 'rxdb';\nimport { getRxStorageSharedWorker } from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-worker';\nimport { RxStorageLokiStatics } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-lokijs';\nconst database = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    storage: getRxStorageSharedWorker(\n        {\n            statics: RxStorageLokiStatics,\n            /**\n             * Path to where the copied file from node_modules/rxdb-premium/dist/workers\n             * is reachable from the webserver.\n             */\n            workerInput: '/indexeddb.shared-worker.js'\n        }\n    )\n});\n\nReplication with SharedWorker\nWhen a SharedWorker RxStorage is used, it is recommended to run the replication inside of the worker.

Returns all documents that have been written after the given checkpoint. Also returns the checkpoint of the latest written returned document.\npushHandler a method that can be called by the client to send client side writes to the master. It gets an array with the assumedMasterState and the newForkState of each document write as input. It must return an array that contains the master document states of all conflicts. If there are no conflicts, it must return an empty array.\npullStream an observable that emits batches of all master writes and the latest checkpoint of the write batches.\n\n        +--------+                             +--------+   \n        |        | pullHandler()               |        |\n        |        |--------------------->       |        |   \n        |        |                             |        | \n        |        |                             |        |  \n        | Client | pushHandler()               | Server |  \n        |        |--------------------->       |        | \n        |        |                             |        |\n        |        |   pullStream$               |        | \n        |        |   The replication runs in two different modes:\nCheckpoint iteration\nOn first initial replication, or when the client comes online again, a checkpoint based iteration is used to catch up with the server state.\nA checkpoint is a subset of the fields of the last pulled document. When the checkpoint is send to the backend via pullHandler(), the backend must be able to respond with all documents that have been written after the given checkpoint.\nFor example if your documents contain an id and an updatedAt field, these two can be used as checkpoint.\nWhen the checkpoint iteration reaches the last checkpoint, where the backend returns an empty array because there are no newer documents, the replication will automatically switch to the event observation mode.\nEvent observation\nWhile the client is connected to the backend, the events from the backend are observed via pullStream$ and persisted to the client.\nIf your backend for any reason is not able to provide a full pullStream$ that contains all events and the checkpoint, you can instead only emit RESYNC events that tell RxDB that anything unknown has changed on the server and it should run the pull replication via checkpoint iteration.\nWhen the client goes offline and online again, it might happen that the pullStream$ has missed out some events. Therefore the pullStream$ should also emit a RESYNC event each time the client reconnects, so that the client can become in sync with the backend via the checkpoint iteration mode.\nData layout on the server\nTo use the replication you first have to ensure that:\n\ndocuments are deterministic sortable by their last write time\ndeterministic means that even if two documents have the same last write time, they have a predictable sort order.\n  This is most often ensured by using the primaryKey as second sort parameter as part of the checkpoint.\n\ndocuments are never deleted, instead the _deleted field is set to true.\nThis is needed so that the deletion state of a document exists in the database and can be replicated with other instances. If your backend uses a different field to mark deleted documents, you have to transform the data in the push/pull handlers or with the modifiers.\n\n\nFor example if your documents look like this:\n{\n    \"id\": \"foobar\",\n    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Wilson\",\n    /**\n     * Contains the last write timestamp\n     * so all documents writes can be sorted by that value\n     * when they are fetched from the remote instance.\n     */\n    \"updatedAt\": 1564483474,\n    /**\n     * Instead of physically deleting documents,\n     * a deleted document gets replicated.\n     */\n    \"_deleted\": false\n}\n\nThen your data is always sortable by updatedAt. This ensures that when RxDB fetches 'new' changes via pullHandler(), it can send the latest updatedAt+id checkpoint to the remote endpoint and then receive all newer documents.\nBy default, the field is _deleted. If your remote endpoint uses a different field to mark deleted documents, you can set the deletedField in the replication options which will automatically map the field on all pull and push requests.\nConflict handling\nWhen multiple clients (or the server) modify the same document at the same time (or when they are offline), it can happen that a conflict arises during the replication.\nA---B1---C1---X    master/server state\n     \\       /\n      B1---C2      fork/client state\nIn the case above, the client would tell the master to move the document state from B1 to C2 by calling pushHandler(). But because the actual master state is C1 and not B1, the master would reject the write by sending back the actual master state C1. \nRxDB resolves all conflicts on the client so it would call the conflict handler of the RxCollection and create a new document state D that can then be written to the master.\nA---B1---C1---X---D    master/server state\n     \\       / \\ /\n      B1---C2---D      fork/client state\nThe default conflict handler will always drop the fork state and use the master state. This ensures that clients that are offline for a very long time, do not accidentally overwrite other peoples changes when they go online again.\nYou can specify a custom conflict handler by setting the property conflictHandler when calling addCollection().\nLearn how to create a custom conflict handler.\nreplicateRxCollection()\nYou can start the replication of a single RxCollection by calling replicateRxCollection() like in the following:\nimport { replicateRxCollection } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication';\nimport {\n    lastOfArray\n} from 'rxdb';\nconst replicationState = await replicateRxCollection({\n    collection: myRxCollection,\n    /**\n     * An id for the replication to identify it\n     * and so that RxDB is able to resume the replication on app reload.\n     * If you replicate with a remote server, it is recommended to put the\n     * server url into the replicationIdentifier.\n     */\n    replicationIdentifier: 'my-rest-replication-to-https://example.com/api/sync',\n    /**\n     * By default it will do an ongoing realtime replication.\n     * By settings live: false the replication will run once until the local state\n     * is in sync with the remote state, then it will cancel itself.\n     * (optional), default is true.\n     */\n    live: true,\n    /**\n     * Time in milliseconds after when a failed backend request\n     * has to be retried.\n     * This time will be skipped if a offline->online switch is detected\n     * via navigator.onLine\n     * (optional), default is 5 seconds.\n     */\n    retryTime: 5 * 1000,\n    /**\n     * When multiInstance is true, like when you use RxDB in multiple browser tabs,\n     * the replication should always run in only one of the open browser tabs.\n     * If waitForLeadership is true, it will wait until the current instance is leader.\n     * If waitForLeadership is false, it will start replicating, even if it is not leader.\n     * [default=true]\n     */\n    waitForLeadership: true,\n    /**\n     * If this is set to false,\n     * the replication will not start automatically\n     * but will wait for replicationState.start() being called.\n     * (optional), default is true\n     */\n    autoStart: true,\n\n    /**\n     * Custom deleted field, the boolean property of the document data that\n     * marks a document as being deleted.\n     * If your backend uses a different fieldname then '_deleted', set the fieldname here.\n     * RxDB will still store the documents internally with '_deleted', setting this field\n     * only maps the data on the data layer.\n     * \n     * If a custom deleted field contains a non-boolean value, the deleted state\n     * of the documents depends on if the value is truthy or not.

The document write could have already reached the remote instance and be processed, while only the answering fails.\nThe remote instance must be designed to handle this properly and to not crash on duplicate data transmissions. \nDepending on your use case, it might be ok to just write the duplicate document data again.\nBut for a more resilient error handling you could compare the last write timestamps or add a unique write id field to the document. This field can then be used to detect duplicates and ignore re-send data.\nAlso the replication has an .error$ stream that emits all RxError objects that arise during replication.\nNotice that these errors contain an inner .parameters.errors field that contains the original error. Also they contain a .parameters.direction field that indicates if the error was thrown during pull or push. You can use these to properly handle errors. For example when the client is outdated, the server might respond with a 426 Upgrade Required error code that can then be used to force a page reload.\nreplicationState.error$.subscribe((error) => {\n    if(\n        error.parameters.errors &&\n        error.parameters.errors[0] &&\n        error.parameters.errors[0].code === 426\n    ) {\n        // client is outdated -> enforce a page reload\n        location.reload();\n    }\n});\n\nSecurity\nBe aware that client side clocks can never be trusted. When you have a client-backend replication, the backend should overwrite the updatedAt timestamp or use another field, when it receives the change from the client.\nRxReplicationState\nThe function replicateRxCollection() returns a RxReplicationState that can be used to manage and observe the replication.\nObservable\nTo observe the replication, the RxReplicationState has some Observable properties:\n// emits each document that was received from the remote\nmyRxReplicationState.received$.subscribe(doc => console.dir(doc));\n\n// emits each document that was send to the remote\nmyRxReplicationState.send$.subscribe(doc => console.dir(doc));\n\n// emits all errors that happen when running the push- & pull-handlers.\nmyRxReplicationState.error$.subscribe(error => console.dir(error));\n\n// emits true when the replication was canceled, false when not.\nmyRxReplicationState.canceled$.subscribe(bool => console.dir(bool));\n\n// emits true when a replication cycle is running, false when not.\nmyRxReplicationState.active$.subscribe(bool => console.dir(bool));\n\nawaitInitialReplication()\nWith awaitInitialReplication() you can await the initial replication that is done when a full replication cycle was successful finished for the first time. The returned promise will never resolve if you cancel the replication before the initial replication can be done.\nWARNING: When multiInstance: true and waitForLeadership: true and another tab is already running the replication, awaitInitialReplication() will not resolve until the other tab is closed and the replication starts in this tab.\nawait myRxReplicationState.awaitInitialReplication();\n\nawaitInSync()\nReturns a Promise that resolves when:\n\nawaitInitialReplication() has emitted.\nAll local data is replicated with the remote.\nNo replication cycle is running or in retry-state.\n\nWARNING: When multiInstance: true and waitForLeadership: true and another tab is already running the replication, awaitInSync() will not resolve until the other tab is closed and the replication starts in this tab.\nawait myRxReplicationState.awaitInSync();\n\nreSync()\nTriggers a RESYNC cycle where the replication goes into checkpoint iteration until the client is in sync with the backend. Used in unit tests or when no proper pull.stream$ can be implemented so that the client only knows that something has been changed but not what.\nmyRxReplicationState.reSync();\n\nIf your backend is not capable of sending events to the client at all, you could run reSync() in an interval so that the client will automatically fetch server changes after some time at least.\n// trigger RESYNC each 10 seconds.\nsetInterval(() => myRxReplicationState.reSync(), 10 * 1000);\n\ncancel()\nCancels the replication. Returns a promise that resolved when everything has been cleaned up.\nawait myRxReplicationState.cancel()\n\nisStopped()\nReturns true if the replication is stopped. This can be if a non-live replication is finished or a replication got canceled.\nreplicationState.isStopped(); // true/false\n\nSetting a custom initialCheckpoint (beta)\nBy default, the push replication will start from the beginning of time and push all documents from there to the remote.\nBy setting a custom push.initialCheckpoint, you can tell the replication to only push writes that are newer than the given checkpoint.\nThis is often used when replication is used together with the schema migration.\nAfter a migration has run, the collection with the new version would push all migrated documents to the remote.\nThis might not be desired, for example when you already have run the migration on the backend server.\n// store the latest checkpoint of a collection\nlet lastLocalCheckpoint: any;\nmyCollection.checkpoint$.subscribe(checkpoint => lastLocalCheckpoint = checkpoint);\n\n// start the replication but only push documents that are newer than the lastLocalCheckpoint\nconst replicationState = replicateRxCollection({\n    collection: myCollection,\n    replicationIdentifier: 'my-custom-replication-with-init-checkpoint',\n    /* ... */\n    push: {\n        handler: /* ... */,\n        initialCheckpoint: lastLocalCheckpoint\n    }\n});\n\nThe same can be done for the other direction by setting a pull.initialCheckpoint. Notice that here we need the remote checkpoint from the backend instead of the one from the RxDB storage.\n// get the last pull checkpoint from the server\nconst lastRemoteCheckpoint = await (await fetch('http://example.com/pull-checkpoint')).json();\n\n// start the replication but only pull documents that are newer than the lastRemoteCheckpoint\nconst replicationState = replicateRxCollection({\n    collection: myCollection,\n    replicationIdentifier: 'my-custom-replication-with-init-checkpoint',\n    /* ... */\n    pull: {\n        handler: /* ... */,\n        initialCheckpoint: lastRemoteCheckpoint\n    }\n});\n\n"},"replication-graphql.html":{"url":"replication-graphql.html","title":"Replication GraphQL","keywords":"","body":"Replication with GraphQL\nThe GraphQL replication provides handlers for GraphQL to run replication with GraphQL as the transportation layer.\nNOTICE: To play around, check out the full example of the RxDB GraphQL replication with server and client\nUsage\nBefore you use the GraphQL replication, make sure you've learned how the RxDB replication works.\nCreating a compatible GraphQL Server\nAt the server-side, there must exist an endpoint which returns newer rows when the last checkpoint is used as input. For example lets say you create a Query pullHuman which returns a list of document writes that happened after the given checkpoint.\nFor the push-replication, you also need a Mutation pushHuman which lets RxDB update data of documents by sending the previous document state and the new client document state.\nAlso for being able to stream all ongoing events, we need a Subscription called streamHuman.\ninput HumanInput {\n    id: ID!,\n    name: String!,\n    lastName: String!,\n    updatedAt: Float!,\n    deleted: Boolean!\n}\ntype Human {\n    id: ID!,\n    name: String!,\n    lastName: String!,\n    updatedAt: Float!,\n    deleted: Boolean!\n}\ninput Checkpoint {\n    id: String!,\n    updatedAt: Float!\n}\ntype HumanPullBulk {\n    documents: [Human]!\n    checkpoint: Checkpoint\n}\n\ntype Query {\n    pullHuman(checkpoint: Checkpoint, limit: Int!): HumanPullBulk!\n}\n\ninput HumanInputPushRow {\n    assumedMasterState: HeroInputPushRowT0AssumedMasterStateT0\n    newDocumentState: HeroInputPushRowT0NewDocumentStateT0!\n}\n\ntype Mutation {\n    # Returns a list of all conflicts\n    # If no document write caused a conflict, return an empty list.\n    pushHuman(rows: [HumanInputPushRow!]): [Human]\n}\n\n# headers are used to authenticate the subscriptions\n# over websockets.\ninput Headers {\n    AUTH_TOKEN: String!;\n}\ntype Subscription {\n    streamHuman(headers: Headers): HumanPullBulk!\n}\n\nThe GraphQL resolver for the pullHuman would then look like:\nconst rootValue = {\n    pullHuman: args => {\n        const minId = args.checkpoint ? args.checkpoint.id : '';\n        const minUpdatedAt = args.checkpoint ? args.checkpoint.updatedAt : 0;\n\n        // sorted by updatedAt first and the id as second\n        const sortedDocuments = documents.sort((a, b) => {\n            if (a.updatedAt > b.updatedAt) return 1;\n            if (a.updatedAt  b.id) return 1;\n                if (a.id  {\n            if (doc.updatedAt  minUpdatedAt) return true;\n            if (doc.updatedAt === minUpdatedAt) {\n                // if updatedAt is equal, compare by id\n                if (doc.id > minId) return true;\n                else return false;\n            }\n        });\n\n        // only return some documents in one batch\n        const limitedDocs = filterForMinUpdatedAtAndId.slice(0, args.limit);\n\n        // use the last document for the checkpoint\n        const lastDoc = limitedDocs[limitedDocs.length - 1];\n        const retCheckpoint = {\n            id: lastDoc.id,\n            updatedAt: lastDoc.updatedAt\n        }\n\n        return {\n            documents: limitedDocs,\n            checkpoint: retCheckpoint\n        }\n\n        return limited;\n    }\n}\n\nFor examples for the other resolvers, consult the GraphQL Example Project.\nRxDB Client\nPull replication\nFor the pull-replication, you first need a pullQueryBuilder. This is a function that gets the last replication checkpoint and a limit as input and returns an object with a GraphQL-query and its variables (or a promise that resolves to the same object). RxDB will use the query builder to construct what is later sent to the GraphQL endpoint.\nconst pullQueryBuilder = (checkpoint, limit) => {\n    /**\n     * The first pull does not have a checkpoint\n     * so we fill it up with defaults\n     */\n    if (!checkpoint) {\n        checkpoint = {\n            id: '',\n            updatedAt: 0\n        };\n    }\n    const query = `query PullHuman($checkpoint: CheckpointInput, $limit: Int!) {\n        pullHuman(checkpoint: $checkpoint, limit: $limit) {\n            documents {\n                id\n                name\n                age\n                updatedAt\n                deleted\n            }\n            checkpoint {\n                id\n                updatedAt\n            }\n        }\n    }`;\n    return {\n        query,\n        variables: {\n            checkpoint,\n            limit\n        }\n    };\n};\n\nWith the queryBuilder, you can then setup the pull-replication.\nimport { replicateGraphQL } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication-graphql';\nconst replicationState = replicateGraphQL(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        // urls to the GraphQL endpoints\n        url: {\n            http: 'http://example.com/graphql'\n        },\n        pull: {\n            queryBuilder: pullQueryBuilder, // the queryBuilder from above\n            modifier: doc => doc, // (optional) modifies all pulled documents before they are handled by RxDB\n            dataPath: undefined, // (optional) specifies the object path to access the document(s).

Here, the builder receives a changed document as input which has to be send to the server. It also returns a GraphQL-Query and its data.\nconst pushQueryBuilder = rows => {\n    const query = `\n    mutation PushHuman($writeRows: [HumanInputPushRow!]) {\n        pushHuman(writeRows: $writeRows) {\n            id\n            name\n            age\n            updatedAt\n            deleted\n        }\n    }\n    `;\n    const variables = {\n        writeRows: rows\n    };\n    return {\n        query,\n        variables\n    };\n};\n\nWith the queryBuilder, you can then setup the push-replication.\nconst replicationState = replicateGraphQL(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        // urls to the GraphQL endpoints\n        url: {\n            http: 'http://example.com/graphql'\n        },\n        push: {\n            queryBuilder: pushQueryBuilder, // the queryBuilder from above\n            /**\n             * batchSize (optional)\n             * Amount of document that will be pushed to the server in a single request.\n             */\n            batchSize: 5,\n            /**\n             * modifier (optional)\n             * Modifies all pushed documents before they are send to the GraphQL endpoint.\n             * Returning null will skip the document.\n             */\n            modifier: doc => doc\n        },\n        headers: {\n            Authorization: 'Bearer abcde...'\n        },\n        pull: {\n            /* ... */\n        },\n        /* ... */\n    }\n);\n\nPull Stream\nTo create a realtime replication, you need to create a pull stream that pulls ongoing writes from the server.\nThe pull stream gets the headers of the RxReplicationState as input, so that it can be authenticated on the backend.\nconst pullStreamQueryBuilder = (headers) => {\n    const query = `subscription onStream($headers: Headers) {\n        streamHero(headers: $headers) {\n            documents {\n                id,\n                name,\n                age,\n                updatedAt,\n                deleted\n            },\n            checkpoint {\n                id\n                updatedAt\n            }\n        }\n    }`;\n    return {\n        query,\n        variables: {\n            headers\n        }\n    };\n};\n\nWith the pullStreamQueryBuilder you can then start a realtime replication.\nconst replicationState = replicateGraphQL(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        // urls to the GraphQL endpoints\n        url: {\n            http: 'http://example.com/graphql',\n            ws: 'ws://example.com/subscriptions' // \nNOTICE: If it is not possible to create a websocket server on your backend, you can use any other method of pull out the ongoing events from the backend and then you can send them into RxReplicationState.emitEvent().\nTransforming null to undefined in optional fields\nGraphQL fills up non-existent optional values with null while RxDB required them to be undefined.\nTherefore, if your schema contains optional properties, you have to transform the pulled data to switch out null to undefined\nconst replicationState: RxGraphQLReplicationState = replicateGraphQL(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        url: {/* ... */},\n        headers: {/* ... */},\n        push: {/* ... */},\n        pull: {\n            queryBuilder: pullQueryBuilder,\n            modifier: (doc => {\n                //Wwe have to remove optional non-existent field values\n                // they are set as null by GraphQL but should be undefined\n                Object.entries(doc).forEach(([k, v]) => {\n                    if (v === null) {\n                        delete doc[k];\n                    }\n                });\n                return doc;\n            })\n        },\n        /* ... */\n    }\n);\n\npull.responseModifier\nWith the pull.responseModifier you can modify the whole response from the GraphQL endpoint before it is processed by RxDB.\nFor example if your endpoint is not capable of returning a valid checkpoint, but instead only returns the plain document array, you can use the responseModifier to aggregate the checkpoint from the returned documents.\nimport {\n\n} from 'rxdb';\nconst replicationState: RxGraphQLReplicationState = replicateGraphQL(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        url: {/* ... */},\n        headers: {/* ... */},\n        push: {/* ... */},\n        pull: {\n            responseModifier: async function(\n                plainResponse, // the exact response that was returned from the server\n                origin, // either 'handler' if plainResponse came from the pull.handler, or 'stream' if it came from the pull.stream\n                requestCheckpoint // if origin==='handler', the requestCheckpoint contains the checkpoint that was send to the backend\n            ) {\n                /**\n                 * In this example we aggregate the checkpoint from the documents array\n                 * that was returned from the graphql endpoint.\n                 */\n                const docs = plainResponse;\n                return {\n                    documents: docs,\n                    checkpoint: docs.length === 0 ? requestCheckpoint : {\n                        name: lastOfArray(docs).name,\n                        updatedAt: lastOfArray(docs).updatedAt\n                    }\n                };\n            }\n        },\n        /* ... */\n    }\n);\n\npush.responseModifier\nIt's also possible to modify the response of a push mutation. For example if your server returns more than the just conflicting docs:\ntype PushResponse {\n    conflicts: [Human]\n    conflictMessages: [ReplicationConflictMessage]\n}\n\ntype Mutation {\n    # Returns a PushResponse type that contains the conflicts along with other information\n    pushHuman(rows: [HumanInputPushRow!]): PushResponse!\n}\n\nimport {} from \"rxdb\";\nconst replicationState: RxGraphQLReplicationState = replicateGraphQL(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        url: {/* ... */},\n        headers: {/* ... */},\n        push: {\n            responseModifier: async function (plainResponse) {\n                /**\n                 * In this example we aggregate the conflicting documents from a response object\n                 */\n                return plainResponse.conflicts;\n            },\n        },\n        pull: {/* ... */},\n        /* ... */\n    }\n);\n\nHelper Functions\nRxDB provides the helper functions graphQLSchemaFromRxSchema(), pullQueryBuilderFromRxSchema(), pullStreamBuilderFromRxSchema() and pushQueryBuilderFromRxSchema() that can be used to generate handlers and schemas from the RxJsonSchema. To learn how to use them, please inspect the GraphQL Example.\nRxGraphQLReplicationState\nWhen you call myCollection.syncGraphQL() it returns a RxGraphQLReplicationState which can be used to subscribe to events, for debugging or other functions. It extends the RxReplicationState with some GraphQL specific methods.\n.setHeaders()\nChanges the headers for the replication after it has been set up.\nreplicationState.setHeaders({\n    Authorization: `...`\n});\n\nSending Cookies\nThe underlying fetch framework uses a same-origin policy for credentials per default. That means, cookies and session data is only shared if you backend and frontend run on the same domain and port. Pass the credential parameter to include cookies in requests to servers from different origins via:\nreplicationState.setCredentials('include');\n\nor directly pass it in the the syncGraphQL:\nreplicateGraphQL(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        /* ... */\n        credentials: 'include',\n        /* ... */\n    }\n);\n\nSee the fetch spec for more information about available options.\nNOTICE: To play around, check out the full example of the RxDB GraphQL replication with server and client\n"},"replication-websocket.html":{"url":"replication-websocket.html","title":"Replication Websocket","keywords":"","body":"Websocket Replication\nWith the websocket replication plugin, you can spawn a websocket server from a RxDB database in Node.js and replicate with it.\nNOTICE: The websocket replication plugin does not have any concept for authentication or permission handling.

This plugin does NOT use the official CouchDB replication protocol because the CouchDB protocol was optimized for server-to-server replication and is not suitable for fast client side applications, mostly because it has to run many HTTP-requests (at least one per document) and also it has to store the whole revision tree of the documents at the client. This makes initial replication and querying very slow.\nBecause the way how RxDB handles revisions and documents is very similar to CouchDB, using the RxDB replication with a CouchDB endpoint is pretty straightforward.\nPros\n\nFaster initial replication.\nWorks with any RxStorage, not just PouchDB.\nEasier conflict handling because conflicts are handled during replication and not afterwards.\nDoes not have to store all document revisions on the client, only stores the newest version.\n\nCons\n\nDoes not support the replication of attachments.\nLike all CouchDB replication plugins, this one is also limited to replicating 6 collections in parallel.

It extends the RxReplicationState so any other method that can be used there can also be used on the CouchDB replication state.\nConflict handling\nWhen conflicts appear during replication, the conflictHandler of the RxCollection is used, equal to the other replication plugins. Read more about conflict handling here.\nAuth example\nLets say for authentication you need to add a bearer token as HTTP header to each request. You can achieve that by crafting a custom fetch() method that add the header field.\n\nconst myCustomFetch = (url, options) => {\n\n    // flat clone the given options to not mutate the input\n    const optionsWithAuth = Object.assign({}, options);\n    // ensure the headers property exists\n    if(!optionsWithAuth.headers) {\n        optionsWithAuth.headers = {};\n    }\n    // add bearer token to headers\n    optionsWithAuth.headers['Authorization'] ='Basic S0VLU0UhIExFQ0...';\n\n    // call the original fetch function with our custom options.\n    return fetch(\n        url,\n        optionsWithAuth\n    );\n};\n\nconst replicationState = replicateCouchDB(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        url: 'http://example.com/db/humans',\n        /**\n         * Add the custom fetch function here.\n         */\n        fetch: myCustomFetch,\n        pull: {},\n        push: {}\n    }\n);\n\nAlso when your bearer token changes over time, you can set a new custom fetch method while the replication is running:\nreplicationState.fetch = newCustomFetchMethod;\n\nAlso there is a helper method getFetchWithCouchDBAuthorization() to create a fetch handler with authorization:\n\nimport { \n    replicateCouchDB,\n    getFetchWithCouchDBAuthorization\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/replication-couchdb';\n\nconst replicationState = replicateCouchDB(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        url: 'http://example.com/db/humans',\n        /**\n         * Add the custom fetch function here.\n         */\n        fetch: getFetchWithCouchDBAuthorization('myUsername', 'myPassword'),\n        pull: {},\n        push: {}\n    }\n);\n\nKnown problems\nDatabase missing\nIn contrast to PouchDB, this plugin does NOT automatically create missing CouchDB databases.\nIf your CouchDB server does not have a database yet, you have to create it by yourself by running a PUT request to the database name url:\n// create a 'humans' CouchDB database on the server\nconst remoteDatabaseName = 'humans';\nawait fetch(\n    'http://example.com/db/' + remoteDatabaseName,\n    {\n        method: 'PUT'\n    }\n);\n\nReact Native\nReact Native does not have a global fetch method. You have to import fetch method with the cross-fetch package:\nimport crossFetch from 'cross-fetch';\nconst replicationState = replicateCouchDB(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        url: 'http://example.com/db/humans',\n        fetch: crossFetch,\n        pull: {},\n        push: {}\n    }\n);\n\n"},"replication-p2p.html":{"url":"replication-p2p.html","title":"Replication P2P","keywords":"","body":"Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Replication with the RxDB JavaScript Database (beta)\nIn the world of web and mobile development, data synchronization between clients and servers has always been a critical aspect of building real-time JavaScript applications.\nTraditionally, the synchronization process relies on centralized servers to manage and distribute data. However, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) replication with WebRTC is changing the game by allowing data to flow directly between clients, eliminating the need for a central server.\nWith the RxDB P2P replication plugin you can replicate the database state between your clients devices fully peer2peer over WebRTC.\nThere is no need for a centralized server to store any of the users data like in a master-slave replication.\nOnly a WebRTC signaling server is required to initially exchange the connection data between clients so that they can establish a WebRTC connection.\nThe replication itself then runs with the RxDB replication protocol. Because RxDB is a NoSQL database and because of the simplicity of its replication protocol, setting up a robust P2P replication is way easier compared to SQL server- or client databases.\nUnderstanding P2P Replication\nP2P replication is a paradigm shift in data synchronization. Instead of relying on a central server to manage data transfers between clients, it leverages the power of direct peer-to-peer connections. This approach offers several advantages:\n\nReduced Latency: With no intermediary server, data can move directly between clients, significantly reducing latency and improving real-time interactions.\nImproved Scalability: P2P networks can easily scale as more clients join, without putting additional load on a central server.\nEnhanced Privacy: Data remains within the client devices, reducing privacy concerns associated with centralized data storage.\n\nUsing the RxDB P2P Replication Plugin\nBefore you use this plugin, make sure that you understand how WebRTC works.\nFirst you have to add the plugin, then you can call RxCollection.syncP2P() to start the replication.\nAs options you have to provide a topic and a connection handler function that implements the P2PConnectionHandlerCreator interface. As default you should start with the getConnectionHandlerSimplePeer method which uses the simple-peer library.\nIn difference to the other replication plugins, the P2P replication returns a replicationPool instead of a single RxReplicationState. The replicationPool contains all replication states of the connected peers in the network.\nimport {\n    replicateP2P,\n    getConnectionHandlerSimplePeer\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/replication-p2p';\n\n\nconst replicationPool = await replicateP2P(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        // The topic is like a 'room-name'. All clients with the same topic\n        // will replicate with each other. In most cases you want to use\n        // a different topic string per user.\n        topic: 'my-users-pool',\n        /**\n         * You need a collection handler to be able to create WebRTC connections.\n         * Here we use the simple peer handler which uses the 'simple-peer' npm library.\n         * To learn how to create a custom connection handler, read the source code,\n         * it is pretty simple.\n         */\n        connectionHandlerCreator: getConnectionHandlerSimplePeer(\n            'wss://example.com:8080',\n            // only in Node.js, we need the wrtc library\n            // because Node.js does not contain the WebRTC API.\n            require('wrtc')\n        ),\n        pull: {},\n        push: {}\n    }\n);\nreplicationPool.error$.subscribe(err => { /* ... */ });\nreplicationPool.cancel();\n\nLive replications\nP2P replication is always live because there can not be a one-time sync when it is always possible to have new Peers that join  the pool. Therefore you cannot set the live: false option like in the other replication plugins.\nSignaling Server\nFor P2P replication to work with the RxDB P2P Replication Plugin, a signaling server is required. The signaling server helps peers discover each other and establish connections.\nCreating a basic signaling server is straightforward. The provided example uses 'socket.io' for WebSocket communication. However, in production, you'd want to create a more robust signaling server with authentication and additional logic to suit your application's needs.\nHere is a quick example implementation of a signaling server that can be used with the connection handler from getConnectionHandlerSimplePeer():\nexport async function startSignalingServer(port: number): Promise {\n    const server = require('http').createServer();\n    const io = require('socket.io')(server);\n    const socketByPeerId = new Map();\n    const socketsByRoom = new Map();\n    io.on('connection', function (socket: any) {\n        socket.on('signal', (message: any) => {\n            socketByPeerId.get(message.to).emit('signal', message);\n        });\n        socket.on('join', (message: any) => {\n            if (!socketsByRoom.has(message.room)) {\n                console.log('START NEW ROOM: ' + message.room);\n                socketsByRoom.set(message.room, []);\n            }\n            socketsByRoom.get(message.room).push({\n                socket,\n                peerId: message.peerId\n            });\n            socketByPeerId.set(message.peerId, socket);\n            const roomPeerIds = socketsByRoom.get(message.room).map((row: any) => row.peerId);\n            socketsByRoom.get(message.room).forEach((row: any) => {\n                row.socket.emit('joined', roomPeerIds);\n            });\n        });\n    });\n    return new Promise(res => {\n        server.listen(port, () => {\n            res('ws://localhost:' + port);\n        });\n    });\n}\n\nConflict detection in P2P replication\nRxDB's conflict handling works by detecting and resolving conflicts that may arise when multiple clients in a decentralized database system attempt to modify the same data concurrently.\nA custom conflict handler can be set up, which is a plain JavaScript function. The conflict handler is run on each replicated document write and resolves the conflict if required. Find out more about RxDB conflict handling here\nStoring replicated data encrypted on client device\nStoring replicated data encrypted on client devices using the RxDB Encryption Plugin is a pivotal step towards bolstering data security and user privacy.\nThe P2P replication plugin seamlessly integrates with the RxDB encryption plugins, providing a robust solution for encrypting sensitive information before it's stored locally. By doing so, it ensures that even if unauthorized access to the device occurs, the data remains protected and unintelligible without the encryption key (or password). This approach is particularly vital in scenarios where user-generated content or confidential data is replicated across devices, as it empowers users with control over their own data while adhering to stringent security standards. Read more about the encryption plugins here.\n"},"replication-firestore.html":{"url":"replication-firestore.html","title":"Replication Firestore","keywords":"","body":"Replication with Firestore from Firebase (beta)\nWith the replication-firestore plugin you can do a two-way realtime replication\nbetween your client side RxDB Database and a Cloud Firestore database that is hosted on the Firebase platform. It will use the RxDB Replication Protocol to manage the replication streams, error- and conflict handling.\n\n  \n\n\n\nReplicating your Firestore state to RxDB can bring multiple benefits compared to using the Firestore directly:\n\nIt can reduce your cloud fees because your queries run against the local state of the documents without touching a server and writes can be batched up locally and send to the backend in bulks. This is mostly the case for read heavy applications.\nYou can run complex NoSQL queries on your documents because you are not bound to the Firestore Query handling. You can also use local indexes, compression and encryption and do things like fulltext search, fully locally.\nYour application can be truly Offline-First because your data is stored in a client side database. In contrast Firestore by itself only provides options to support offline also which more works like a cache and requires the user to be online at application start to run authentication.\nIt reduces the vendor lock in because you can switch out the backend server afterwards without having to rebuild big parts of the application. RxDB supports replication plugins with multiple technologies and it is even easy to set up with your custom backend.\nYou can use sophisticated conflict resolution strategies so you are not bound to the Firestore last-write-wins strategy which is not suitable for many applications.\nThe initial load time of your application can be decreased because it will do an incremental replication on restarts.\n\nUsage\nFirst initialize your Firestore database like you would do without RxDB.\nimport * as firebase from 'firebase/app';\nimport {\n    getFirestore,\n    collection\n} from 'firebase/firestore';\n\nconst projectId = 'my-project-id';\nconst app = firebase.initializeApp({\n    projectId,\n    databaseURL: 'http://localhost:8080?ns=' + projectId,\n    /* ... */\n});\nconst firestoreDatabase = getFirestore(app);\nconst firestoreCollection = collection(firestoreDatabase, 'my-collection-name');\n\nThen you can start the replication by calling replicateFirestore() on your RxCollection.\nconst replicationState = replicateFirestore(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        firestore: {\n            projectId,\n            database: firestoreDatabase,\n            collection: firestoreCollection\n        },\n        pull: {},\n        push: {},\n        /**\n         * Either do a live or a one-time replication\n         * [default=true]\n         */\n        live: true,\n        /**\n         * (optional) likely you should just use the default.\n         *\n         * In firestore it is not possible to read out\n         * the internally used write timestamp of a document.\n         * Even if we could read it out, it is not indexed which\n         * is required for fetch 'changes-since-x'.\n         * So instead we have to rely on a custom user defined field\n         * that contains the server time which is set by firestore via serverTimestamp()\n         * IMPORTANT: The serverTimestampField MUST NOT be part of the collections RxJsonSchema!\n         * [default='serverTimestamp']\n         */\n        serverTimestampField: 'serverTimestamp'\n    }\n);\n\nTo observe and cancel the replication, you can use any other methods from the ReplicationState like error$, cancel() and awaitInitialReplication().\nHandling deletes\nRxDB requires you to never fully delete documents. This is needed to be able to replicate the deletion state of a document to other instances. The firestore replication will set a boolean _deleted field to all documents to indicate the deletion state. You can change this by setting a different deletedField in the sync options.\nDo not set enableIndexedDbPersistence()\nFirestore has the enableIndexedDbPersistence() feature which caches document states locally to IndexedDB. This is not needed when you replicate your Firestore with RxDB because RxDB itself will store the data locally already.\nUsing the replication with an already existing Firestore Database State\nIf you have not used RxDB before and you already have documents inside of your Firestore database, you have\nto manually set the _deleted field to false and the serverTimestamp to all existing documents.\nimport {\n    getDocs,\n    query,\n    serverTimestamp\n} from 'firebase/firestore';\nconst allDocsResult = await getDocs(query(firestoreCollection));\nallDocsResult.forEach(doc => {\n    doc.update({\n        _deleted: false,\n        serverTimestamp: serverTimestamp()\n    })\n});\n\nAlso notice that if you do writes from non-RxDB applications, you have to keep these fields in sync. It is recommended to use the Firestore triggers to ensure that.\nFiltered Replication\nYou might need to replicate only a subset of your collection, either to or from Firestore. You can achieve this using push.filter and pull.filter options.\nconst replicationState = replicateFirestore(\n    {\n        collection: myRxCollection,\n        firestore: {\n            projectId,\n            database: firestoreDatabase,\n            collection: firestoreCollection\n        },\n        pull: {\n            filter: [\n                where('ownerId', '==', userId)\n            ]\n        },\n        push: {\n            filter: (item) => item.syncEnabled === true\n        }\n    }\n);\n\nKeep in mind that you can not use inequality operators (, or >=) in pull.filter since that would cause a conflict with ordering by serverTimestamp.\n"},"replication-nats.html":{"url":"replication-nats.html","title":"Replication NATS","keywords":"","body":"Replication with NATS (beta)\nWith this RxDB plugin you can run a two-way realtime replication with a NATS server.\nThe replication itself uses the RxDB replication protocol which handles conflicts, errors and retries.\nOn the client side the official NATS npm package is used to connect to the NATS server.\nNATS is a messaging system that by itself does not have a validation or granulary access control build in.\nTherefore it is not recommended to directly replicate the NATS server with an untrusted RxDB client application. Instead you should replicated from NATS to your Node.js server side RxDB database.\nPrecondition\nFor the replication endpoint the NATS cluster must have enabled JetStream and store all message data as structured JSON.\nThe easiest way to start a compatible NATS server is to use the official docker image:\ndocker run --rm --name rxdb-nats -p 4222:4222 nats:2.9.17 -js\nUsage\nTo start the replication, import the replicateNats() method from the RxDB plugin and call it with the collection\nthat must be replicated.\nThe replication runs per RxCollection, you can replicate multiple RxCollections by starting a new replication for each of them.\nimport {\n    replicateNats\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/replication-nats';\n\nconst replicationState = replicateNats({\n    collection: myRxCollection,\n    replicationIdentifier: 'my-nats-replication-collection-A',\n    // in NATS, each stream need a name\n    streamName: 'stream-for-replication-A',\n    /**\n     * The subject prefix determines how the documents are stored in NATS.\n     * For example the document with id 'alice' will have the subject 'foobar.alice'\n     */\n    subjectPrefix: 'foobar',\n    connection: { servers: 'localhost:4222' },\n    live: true,\n    pull: {\n        batchSize: 30\n    },\n    push: {\n        batchSize: 30\n    }\n});\n\nHandling deletes\nRxDB requires you to never fully delete documents.

It seamlessly integrates with RxDB, allowing for the secure storage and retrieval of documents by encrypting them with a password. With encryption and decryption processes handled internally, it ensures that sensitive data remains confidential, making it a valuable tool for building robust, privacy-conscious applications. The encryption works on all RxDB supported devices types like the browser, ReactNative or Node.js.\n\n  \n\n\nEncrypting client-side stored data in RxDB offers numerous advantages:\n\nEnhanced Security: In the unfortunate event of a user's device being stolen, the encrypted data remains safeguarded on the hard drive, inaccessible without the correct password.\nAccess Control: You can retain control over stored data by revoking access at any time simply by withholding the password.\nTamper proof Other applications on the device cannot read out the stored data when the password is only kept in the process-specific memory\n\nQuerying encrypted data\nRxDB handles the encryption and decryption of data internally. This means that when you work with a RxDocument, you can access the properties of the document just like you would with normal, unencrypted data. RxDB automatically decrypts the data for you when you retrieve it, making it transparent to your application code.\nThis means the encryption works with all RxStorage like SQLite, IndexedDB, OPFS and so on.\nHowever, there's a limitation when it comes to querying encrypted fields. Encrypted fields cannot be used as operators in queries. This means you cannot perform queries like \"find all documents where the encrypted field equals a certain value.\" RxDB does not expose the encrypted data in a way that allows direct querying based on the encrypted content. To filter or search for documents based on the contents of encrypted fields, you would need to first decrypt the data and then perform the query, which might not be efficient or practical in some cases.\nYou could however use the memory synced RxStorage to replicate the encrypted documents into a non-encrypted in-memory storage and then query them like normal.\nPassword handling\nRxDB does not define how you should store or retrieve the encryption password. It only requires you to provide the password on database creation which grants you flexibility in how you manage encryption passwords.\nYou could ask the user on app-start to insert the password, or you can retrieve the password from your backend on app start (or revoke access by no longer providing the password).\nAsymmetric encryption\nThe encryption plugin itself uses symmetric encryption with a password to guarantee best performance when reading and storing data.\nIt is not able to do Asymmetric encryption by itself. If you need Asymmetric encryption with a private/publicKey, it is recommended to encrypted the password itself with the asymentric keys and store the encrypted password beside the other data. On app-start you can decrypt the password with the private key and use the decrypted passwort in the RxDB encryption plugin\nUsing the RxDB Encryption Plugins\nRxDB currently has two plugins for encryption:\n\nThe free encryption-crypto-js plugin that is based on the AES algorithm of the crypto-js library\nThe premium encryption-web-crypto plugin that is based on the native Web Crypto API which makes it faster and more secure to use. Document inserts are about 10x faster compared to crypto-js and it has a smaller build size because it uses the browsers API instead of bundling an npm module.\n\nAn RxDB encryption plugin is a wrapper around any other RxStorage. \n\nYou first have to wrap your RxStorage with the encryption\nThen use that as RxStorage when calling createRxDatabase()\nAlso you have to set a password when creating the database. The format of the password depends on which encryption plugin is used.\nTo define a field as being encrypted, you have to add it to the encrypted fields list in the schema.\n\nimport { wrappedKeyEncryptionCryptoJsStorage } from 'rxdb/plugins/encryption-crypto-js';\nimport { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';\n\n\n// wrap the normal storage with the encryption plugin\nconst encryptedDexieStorage = wrappedKeyEncryptionCryptoJsStorage({\n    storage: getRxStorageDexie()\n});\n\n// create an encrypted database\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    storage: encryptedDexieStorage,\n    password: 'foooooobaaaaar'\n});\n\n\nconst schema = {\n  version: 0,\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string',\n          maxLength: 100\n      },\n      secret: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n  },\n  required: ['id']\n  encrypted: ['secret']\n};\n\nawait db.addCollections({\n    myDocuments: {\n        schema\n    }\n})\n/* ... */\n\nOr with the web-crypto premium plugin:\nimport {\n    wrappedKeyEncryptionWebCryptoStorage,\n    createPassword\n} from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/encryption-web-crypto';\nimport { getRxStorageIndexedDB } from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-indexeddb';\n\n// wrap the normal storage with the encryption plugin\nconst encryptedIndexedDbStorage = wrappedKeyEncryptionWebCryptoStorage({\n    storage: getRxStorageIndexedDB()\n});\n\nconst myPasswordObject = {\n    // Algorithm can be oneOf: 'AES-CTR' | 'AES-CBC' | 'AES-GCM'\n    algorithm: 'AES-CTR',\n    password: 'myRandomPasswordWithMin8Length'\n};\n\n// create an encrypted database\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    storage: encryptedIndexedDbStorage,\n    password: myPasswordObject\n});\n\n/* ... */\n\nChanging the password\nThe password is set database specific and it is not possible to change the password of a database.

After a while, you decide that in your new version, you want to change the schema of the messages-collection. Instead of saving the message-date like 2017-02-12T23:03:05+00:00 you want to have the unix-timestamp like 1486940585 to make it easier to compare dates. To accomplish this, you change the schema and increase the version-number and you also change your code where you save the incoming messages. But one problem remains: what happens with the messages which are already saved on the user's device in the old schema?\nWith RxDB you can provide migrationStrategies for your collections that automatically (or on call) transform your existing data from older to newer schemas. This assures that the client's data always matches your newest code-version.\nAdd the migration plugin\nTo enable the data migration, you have to add the migration plugin.\nimport { addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\nimport { RxDBMigrationPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/migration';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBMigrationPlugin);\n\nProviding strategies\nUpon creation of a collection, you have to provide migrationStrategies when your schema's version-number is greater than 0. To do this, you have to add an object to the migrationStrategies property where a function for every schema-version is assigned. A migrationStrategy is a function which gets the old document-data as a parameter and returns the new, transformed document-data. If the strategy returns null, the document will be removed instead of migrated.\nmyDatabase.addCollections({\n  messages: {\n    schema: messageSchemaV1,\n    migrationStrategies: {\n      // 1 means, this transforms data from version 0 to version 1\n      1: function(oldDoc){\n        oldDoc.time = new Date(oldDoc.time).getTime(); // string to unix\n        return oldDoc;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nAsynchronous strategies can also be used:\nmyDatabase.addCollections({\n  messages: {\n    schema: messageSchemaV1,\n    migrationStrategies: {\n      1: function(oldDoc){\n        oldDoc.time = new Date(oldDoc.time).getTime(); // string to unix\n        return oldDoc;\n      },\n      /**\n       * 2 means, this transforms data from version 1 to version 2\n       * this returns a promise which resolves with the new document-data\n       */\n      2: function(oldDoc){\n        // in the new schema (version: 2) we defined 'senderCountry' as required field (string)\n        // so we must get the country of the message-sender from the server\n        const coordinates = oldDoc.coordinates;\n        return fetch('http://myserver.com/api/countryByCoordinates/'+coordinates+'/')\n          .then(response => {\n            const response = response.json();\n            oldDoc.senderCountry=response;\n            return oldDoc;\n          });\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nyou can also filter which documents should be migrated:\nmyDatabase.addCollections({\n  messages: {\n    schema: messageSchemaV1,\n    migrationStrategies: {\n      // 1 means, this transforms data from version 0 to version 1\n      1: function(oldDoc){\n        oldDoc.time = new Date(oldDoc.time).getTime(); // string to unix\n        return oldDoc;\n      },\n      /**\n       * this removes all documents older then 2017-02-12\n       * they will not appear in the new collection\n       */\n      2: function(oldDoc){\n        if(oldDoc.time \nautoMigrate\nBy default, the migration automatically happens when the collection is created. If you have lots of data or the migrationStrategies take a long time, it might be better to start the migration 'by hand' and show the migration-state to the user as a loading-bar.\nconst messageCol = await myDatabase.addCollections({\n  messages: {\n    schema: messageSchemaV1,\n    autoMigrate: false, //  console.dir(state),\n  error => console.error(error),\n  done => console.log('done')\n);\n\n// the emitted states look like this:\n{\n    done: false, // true if finished\n    total: 50,   // amount of documents which must be migrated\n    handled: 0,  // amount of handled docs\n    success: 0,  // handled docs which succeeded\n    deleted: 0,  // handled docs which got deleted\n    percent: 0   // percentage\n}\n\nIf you don't want to show the state to the user, you can also use .migratePromise():\n  const migrationPromise = messageCol.migratePromise(10);\n  await migratePromise;\n\nmigrationStates()\nRxDatabase.migrationStates() returns an Observable that emits all events to the ongoing migrations of all RxCollections.

Count them, I will wait..\nSo if you would now inspect the traffic that these open tabs produce, you can see that many of them send exact the same data over wire for every tab. No matter if the data is sent with an open websocket or by polling.\nUse-case-example\nImagine we have a website which displays the current temperature of the visitors location in various charts, numbers or heatmaps. To always display the live-data, the website opens a websocket to our API-Server which sends the current temperature every 10 seconds. Using the way most sites are currently build, we can now open it in 5 browser-tabs and it will open 5 websockets which send data 6*5=30 times per minute. This will not only waste the power of your clients device, but also wastes your api-servers resources by opening redundant connections.\nSolution\nThe solution to this redundancy is the usage of a leader-election-algorithm which makes sure that always exactly one tab is managing the remote-data-access. The managing tab is the elected leader and stays leader until it is closed. No matter how many tabs are opened or closed, there must be always exactly one leader.\nYou could now start implementing a messaging-system between your browser-tabs, hand out which one is leader, solve conflicts and reassign a new leader when the old one 'dies'.\nOr just use RxDB which does all these things for you.\nAdd the leader election plugin\nTo enable the leader election, you have to add the leader-election plugin.\nimport { addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\nimport { RxDBLeaderElectionPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/leader-election';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBLeaderElectionPlugin);\n\nCode-example\nTo make it easy, here is an example where the temperature is pulled every ten seconds and saved to a collection. The pulling starts at the moment where the opened tab becomes the leader.\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'weatherDB',\n  storage: getRxStorageDexie(),\n  password: 'myPassword',\n  multiInstance: true\n});\nawait db.addCollections({\n  temperature: {\n    schema: mySchema\n  }\n});\n\ndb.waitForLeadership()\n  .then(() => {\n    console.log('Long lives the king!'); //  {\n      const temp = await fetch('https://example.com/api/temp/');\n      db.temperature.insert({\n          degrees: temp,\n          time: new Date().getTime()\n      });\n    }, 1000 * 10);\n  });\n\nHandle Duplicate Leaders\nOn rare occasions, it can happen that more then one leader is elected. This can happen when the CPU is on 100% or for any other reason the JavaScript process is fully blocked for a long time.\nFor most cases this is not really problem because on duplicate leaders, both browser tabs replicate with the same backend anyways.\nTo handle the duplicate leader event, you can access the leader elector and set a handler:\nimport {\n    getLeaderElectorByBroadcastChannel\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/leader-election';\n\nconst leaderElector = getLeaderElectorByBroadcastChannel(broadcastChannel);\nleaderElector.onduplicate = async () => {\n    // Duplicate leader detected -> reload the page.\n    location.reload();\n}\n\nLive-Example\nIn this example the leader is marked with the crown ♛\n\nTry it out\nRun the vanillaJS-example where the leading tab is marked with a crown on the top-right-corner.\nNotice\nThe leader election is implemented via the  broadcast-channel module.\nThe leader is elected between different processes on the same javascript-runtime.

Two different clients could do a write to the same document at the same time or while they are both offline. When the clients replicate the document state with the server, a conflict emerges that must be resolved by the system.\nIn RxDB, conflicts are normally resolved by setting a conflictHandler when creating a collection. The conflict handler is a JavaScript function that gets the two conflicting states of the same document and it will return the resolved document state.\nThe default conflict handler will always drop the fork state and use the master state to ensure that clients that have been offline for a long time, do not overwrite other clients changes when they go online again.\n\n  \n\n\n\nWith CRDTs (short for Conflict-free replicated data type), all document \nwrites are represented as CRDT operations in plain JSON. The CRDT operations are stored together with the document and each time a conflict arises, the CRDT conflict handler will automatically merge the operations in a deterministic way. Using CRDTs is an easy way to \"magically\" handle all conflict problems in your application by storing the deltas of writes together with the document data.\n\n  \n\n\nRxDB CRDT operations\nIn RxDB, a CRDT operation is defined with NoSQL update operators, like you might know them from MongoDB update operations or the RxDB update plugin.\nTo run the operators, RxDB uses the modifyjs library.\nA CRDT operator example:\nconst myCRDTOperation = {\n    // increment the points field by +1\n    $inc: {\n        points: 1\n    },\n    // set the modified field to true\n    $set: {\n        modified: true\n    }\n};\n\nOperators\nAt the moment, not all possible operators are implemented in modifyjs, if you need additional ones, you should make a pull request there.\nThe following operators can be used at this point in time:\n\n$min\n$max\n$inc\n$set\n$unset\n$push\n$pushAll\n$addToSet\n$pop\n$pullAll\n$rename\n\nFor the exact definition on how each operator behaves, check out the MongoDB documentation on update operators.\nInstallation\nTo use CRDTs with RxDB, you need the following:\n\nAdd the CRDT plugin via addRxPlugin.\nAdd a field to your schema that defines where to store the CRDT operations via getCRDTSchemaPart()\nSet the crdt options in your schema.\nDo NOT set a custom conflict handler, the plugin will use its own one.\n\n// import the relevant parts from the CRDT plugin\nimport {\n    getCRDTSchemaPart,\n    RxDBcrdtPlugin\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/crdt';\n\n// add the CRDT plugin to RxDB\nimport { addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\naddRxPlugin(RxDDcrdtPlugin);\n\n// create a database\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb';\nimport { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';\nconst myDatabase = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'heroesdb',\n  storage: getRxStorageDexie()\n});\n\n// create a schema with the CRDT options\nconst mySchema = {\n    version: 0,\n    primaryKey: 'id',\n    type: 'object',\n    properties: {\n        id: {\n            type: 'string',\n            maxLength: 100\n        },\n        points: {\n            type: 'number',\n            maximum: 100,\n            minimum: 0\n        },\n        crdts: getCRDTSchemaPart() // use this field to store the CRDT operations\n    },\n    required: ['id', 'points'],\n    crdt: { // CRDT options\n        field: 'crdts'\n    }\n}\n\n// add a collection\nawait db.addCollections({\n    users: {\n        schema: mySchema\n    }\n});\n\n// insert a document\nconst myDocument = await db.users.insert({id: 'alice', points: 0});\n\n// run a CRDT operation that increments the 'points' by one\nawait myDocument.updateCRDT({\n    ifMatch: {\n        $inc: {\n            points: 1\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nConditional CRDT operations\nBy default, all CRDTs operations will be run to build the current document state. But in many cases, more granular operations are required to better reflect the desired business logic. For these cases, conditional CRDTs can be used.\nFor example if you have a field points with a maximum of 100, you might want to only run an $inc operations, if the points value is less then 100.\nIn an conditional CRDT, you can specify a selector and the operation sets ifMatch and ifNotMatch. At each time the CRDT is applied to the document state, first the selector will run and evaluate which operations path must be used.\nawait myDocument.updateCRDT({\n    // only if the selector matches, the ifMatch operation will run\n    selector: {\n        age: {\n            $lt: 100\n        }\n    },\n    // an operation that runs if the selector matches\n    ifMatch: {\n        $inc: {\n            points: 1\n        }\n    },\n    // if the selector does NOT match, you could run a different operation instead\n    ifNotMatch: {\n        // ...\n    }\n});\n\nRunning multiples operations at once\nBy default, one CRDT operation is applied to the document in a single database write.\nTo represent more complex logic chains, it might make sense to use multiple CRDTs and write them at once inside of a single atomic document write.\nFor these cases, the updateCRDT() method allows to pass an array of operations.\nawait myDocument.updateCRDT([\n    {\n        selector: { /** ... **/ },\n        ifMatch: { /** ... **/ }\n    },\n    {\n        selector: { /** ... **/ },\n        ifMatch: { /** ... **/ }\n    },\n    {\n        selector: { /** ... **/ },\n        ifMatch: { /** ... **/ }\n    },\n    {\n        selector: { /** ... **/ },\n        ifMatch: { /** ... **/ }\n    }\n]);\n\nCRDTs on inserts\nWhen CRDTs are enabled with the plugin, all insert operations are automatically mapped as CRDT operation with the $set operator.\n// Calling RxCollection.insert()\nawait myRxCollection.insert({\n    id: 'foo'\n    points: 1\n});\n// is exactly equal to calling insertCRDT()\nawait myRxCollection.insertCRDT({\n    ifMatch: {\n        $set: {\n            id: 'foo'\n            points: 1\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nWhen the same document is inserted in multiple client instances and then replicated, a conflict will emerge and the insert-CRDTs will overwrite each other in a deterministic order.\nYou can use insertCRDT() to make conditional insert operations with any logic. To check for the previous existence of a document, use the $exists query operation on the primary key of the document.\nawait myRxCollection.insertCRDT({\n    selector: {\n        // only run if the document did not exist before.\n        id: { $exists: false }\n    }, \n    ifMatch: {\n        // if the document did not exist, insert it\n        $set: {\n            id: 'foo'\n            points: 1\n        }\n    },\n    ifNotMatch: {\n        // if document existed already, increment the points by +1\n        $inc: {\n            points: 1\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nDeleting documents\nYou can delete a document with a CRDT operation by setting _deleted to true. Calling RxDocument.remove() will do exactly the same when CRDTs are activated.\nawait doc.updateCRDT({\n    ifMatch: {\n        $set: {\n            _deleted: true\n        }\n    }\n});\n\n// OR\nawait doc.remove();\n\nCRDTs with replication\nCRDT operations are stored inside of a special field besides your 'normal' document fields.\nWhen replicating document data with the RxDB replication or the CouchDB replication or even any custom replication, the CRDT operations must be replicated together with the document data as if they would be 'normal' a document property.\nWhen any instances makes a write to the document, it is required to update the CRDT operations accordingly. For example if your custom backend updates a document, it must also do that by adding a CRDT operation. In dev-mode RxDB will refuse to store any document data where the document properties do not match the result of the CRDT operations.\nWhy not automerge.js or yjs?\nThere are already CRDT libraries out there that have been considered to be used with RxDB. The biggest ones are automerge and yjs. The decision was made to not use these but instead go for a more NoSQL way of designing the CRDT format because:\n\nUsers do not have to learn a new syntax but instead can use the NoSQL operations which they already know.\nRxDB is often used to replicate data with any custom backend on an already existing infrastructure. Using NoSQL operators instead of binary data in CRDTs, makes it easy to implement the exact same logic on these backends so that the backend can also do document writes and still be compliant to the RxDB CRDT plugin.\n\nWhen to not use CRDTs\nCRDT can only be use when your business logic allows to represent document changes via static json operators.\nIf you can have cases where user interaction is required to correctly merge conflicting document states, you cannot use CRDTs for that.\nAlso when CRDTs are used, it is no longer allowed to do non-CRDT writes to the document properties.\n\n"},"third-party-plugins.html":{"url":"third-party-plugins.html","title":"Third Party Plugins","keywords":"","body":"Third Party Plugins\n\nrxdb-hooks A set of hooks to integrate RxDB into react applications.\nrxdb-flexsearch The full text search for RxDB using FlexSearch.\nrxdb-orion Enables replication with Laravel Orion.\nrxdb-supabase Enables replication with Supabase.\nrxdb-utils Additional features for RxDB like models, timestamps, default values, view and more.\n\n"},"plugins.html":{"url":"plugins.html","title":"Creating Plugins","keywords":"","body":"Creating Plugins\nCreating your own plugin is very simple.

Instead, RxDB has to apply different techniques that better suit the offline-first, client side world where it is not possible to create a transaction between multiple maybe-offline client devices.\nWhy RxDB does not have transactions\nWhen talking about transactions, we mean ACID transactions that guarantee the properties of atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.\nWith an ACID transaction you can mutate data dependent on the current state of the database. It is ensured that no other database operations happen in between your transaction and after the transaction has finished, it is guaranteed that the new data is actually written to the disc.\nTo implement ACID transactions on a single server, the database has to keep track on who is running transactions and then schedule these transactions so that they can run in isolation.\nAs soon as you have to split your database on multiple servers, transaction handling becomes way more difficult. The servers have to communicate with each other to find a consensus about which transaction can run and which has to wait. Network connections might break, or one server might complete its part of the transaction and then be required to roll back its changes because of an error on another server. \nBut with RxDB you have multiple clients that can go randomly online or offline. The users can have different devices and the clock of these devices can go off by any time. To support ACID transactions here, RxDB would have to make the whole world stand still for all clients, while one client is doing a write operation. And even that can only work when all clients are online. Implementing that might be possible, but at the cost of an unpredictable amount of performance loss and not being able to support offline-first.\n\nA single write operation to a document is the only atomic thing you can do in RxDB.\n\nThe benefits of not having to support transactions:\n\nClients can read and write data without blocking each other.\nClients can write data while being offline and then replicate with a server when they are online again, called offline-first.\nCreating a compatible backend for the replication is easy so that RxDB can replicate with any existing infrastructure.\nOptimizations like Sharding can be used.\n\nRevisions\nWorking without transactions leads to having undefined state when doing multiple database operations at the same time. Most client side databases rely on a last-write-wins strategy on write operations. This might be a viable solution for some cases, but often this leads to strange problems that are hard to debug.\nInstead, to ensure that the behavior of RxDB is always predictable, RxDB relies on revisions for version control. Revisions work similar to Lamport Clocks.\nEach document is stored together with its revision string, that looks like 1-9dcca3b8e1a and consists of:\n\nThe revision height, a number that starts with 1 and is increased with each write to that document.\nThe database instance token.\n\nAn operation to the RxDB data layer does not only contain the new document data, but also the previous document data with its revision string. If the previous revision matches the revision that is currently stored in the database, the write operation can succeed. If the previous revision is different than the revision that is currently stored in the database, the operation will throw a 409 CONFLICT error.\nConflicts\nThere are two types of conflicts in RxDB, the local conflict and the replication conflict.\nLocal conflicts\nA local conflict can happen when a write operation assumes a different previous document state, then what is currently stored in the database. This can happen when multiple parts of your application do simultaneous writes to the same document. This can happen on a single browser tab, or when multiple tabs write at once or when a write appears while the document gets replicated from a remote server replication.\nWhen a local conflict appears, RxDB will throw a 409 CONFLICT error. The calling code must then handle the error properly, depending on the application logic.\nInstead of handling local conflicts, in most cases it is easier to ensure that they cannot happen, by using incremental database operations like incrementalModify(), incrementalPatch() or incrementalUpsert(). These write operations have a build in way to handle conflicts by re-applying the mutation functions to the conflicting document state.\nReplication conflicts\nA replication conflict appears when multiple clients write to the same documents at once and these documents are then replicated to the backend server. \nWhen you replicate with the Graphql replication and the replication primitives, RxDB assumes that conflicts are detected and resolved at the client side.\nWhen a document is send to the backend and the backend detected a conflict (by comparing revisions or other properties), the backend will respond with the actual document state so that the client can compare this with the local document state and create a new, resolved document state that is then pushed to the server again. You can read more about the replication protocol here.\nCustom conflict handler\nA conflict handler is a JavaScript function that has two tasks:\n\nDetect if a conflict exists\nSolve existing conflicts \n\nBecause the conflict handler also is used for conflict detection, it will run many times on pull-, push- and write operations of RxDB. Most of the time it will detect that there is no conflict and then return.\nLets have a look at the default conflict handler of RxDB to learn how to create a custom one:\nexport const defaultConflictHandler: RxConflictHandler = function (\n    /**\n     * The conflict handler gets 3 input properties:\n     * - assumedMasterState: The state of the document that is assumed to be on the master branch\n     * - newDocumentState: The new document state of the fork branch (=client) that RxDB want to write to the master\n     * - realMasterState: The real master state of the document\n     */\n    i: RxConflictHandlerInput\n): Promise> {\n    /**\n     * Here we detect if a conflict exists in the first place.\n     * If there is no conflict, we return isEqual=true.\n     * If there is a conflict, return isEqual=false.\n     * In the default handler we do a deepEqual check,\n     * but in your custom conflict handler you probably want\n     * to compare specific properties of the document, like the updatedAt time,\n     * for better performance because deepEqual() is expensive.\n     */\n    if (deepEqual(\n        i.newDocumentState,\n        i.realMasterState\n    )) {\n        return Promise.resolve({\n            isEqual: true\n        });\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * If a conflict exists, we have to resolve it.\n     * The default conflict handler will always\n     * drop the fork state and use the master state instead.\n     * \n     * In your custom conflict handler you likely want to merge properties\n     * of the realMasterState and the newDocumentState instead.\n     */\n    return Promise.resolve({\n        isEqual: false,\n        documentData: i.realMasterState\n    });\n};\n\nTo overwrite the default conflict handler, you have to specify a custom conflictHandler property when creating a collection with addCollections().\nconst myCollections = await myDatabase.addCollections({\n  // key = collectionName\n  humans: {\n    schema: mySchema,\n    conflictHandler: myCustomConflictHandler\n  }\n});\n\n"},"tutorials/typescript.html":{"url":"tutorials/typescript.html","title":"Use RxDB with Typescript","keywords":"","body":"Using RxDB with TypeScript\n\nIn this tutorial you will learn how to use RxDB with TypeScript.\nWe will create a basic database with one collection and several ORM-methods, fully typed!\nRxDB directly comes with its typings and you do not have to install anything else, however the latest version of RxDB (v9+) requires that you are using Typescript v3.8 or higher.\nOur way to go is\n\nFirst define what the documents look like\nThen define what the collections look like\nThen define what the database looks like\n\nDeclare the types\nFirst you import the types from RxDB.\nimport {\n    createRxDatabase,\n    RxDatabase,\n    RxCollection,\n    RxJsonSchema,\n    RxDocument,\n} from 'rxdb';\n\nCreate the base document type\nFirst we have to define the TypeScript type of the documents of a collection:\nOption A: Create the document type from the schema\nimport {\n    toTypedRxJsonSchema,\n    ExtractDocumentTypeFromTypedRxJsonSchema,\n    RxJsonSchema\n} from 'rxdb';\nexport const heroSchemaLiteral = {\n    title: 'hero schema',\n    description: 'describes a human being',\n    version: 0,\n    keyCompression: true,\n    primaryKey: 'passportId',\n    type: 'object',\n    properties: {\n        passportId: {\n            type: 'string',\n            maxLength: 100 // ;\n\n// create the typed RxJsonSchema from the literal typed object.\nexport const heroSchema: RxJsonSchema = heroSchemaLiteral;\n\nOption B: Manually type the document type\nexport type HeroDocType = {\n    passportId: string;\n    firstName: string;\n    lastName: string;\n    age?: number;

While RxDB was initially created to be used with UI applications, it has been matured and optimized to make it useful for pure server-side use cases. It can be used as embedded, local database inside of the Node.js JavaScript process, or it can be used similar to a database server that Node.js can connect to. The RxStorage layer makes it possible to switch out the underlying storage engine which makes RxDB a very flexible database that can be optimized for many scenarios.\n\n  \n\n\nPersistent Database\nTo get a \"normal\" database where the data is persisted to a file system, RxDB provides multiple storage implementations.\nThe FoundationDB storage connects to a FoundationDB cluster which itself is just a distributed key-value engine. RxDB adds the NoSQL query-engine, indexes and other features on top of it.\nIt scales horizontally because you can always add more servers to the FoundationDB cluster to increase the capacity.\nSetting up a RxDB database is pretty simple. You import the FoundationDB RxStorage and tell RxDB to use that when calling createRxDatabase:\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb';\nimport { getRxStorageFoundationDB } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-foundationdb';\n\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'exampledb',\n    storage: getRxStorageFoundationDB({\n        apiVersion: 620,\n        clusterFile: '/path/to/fdb.cluster'\n    })\n});\n\n// add a collection\nawait db.addCollections({\n    users: {\n        schema: mySchema\n    }\n});\n\n// run a query\nconst result = await db.users.find({\n    selector: {\n        name: 'foobar'\n    }\n}).exec();\n\nAnother alternative storage is the SQLite RxStorage that stores the data inside of a SQLite filebased database. The SQLite storage is faster then FoundationDB and does not require to set up a cluster or anything because SQLite directly stores and reads the data inside of the filesystem. The downside of that is that it only scales vertically.\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb';\nimport {\n    getRxStorageSQLite,\n    getSQLiteBasicsNode\n} from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-sqlite';\nimport sqlite3 from 'sqlite3';\nconst myRxDatabase = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'path/to/database/file/foobar.db',\n    storage: getRxStorageSQLite({\n        sqliteBasics: getSQLiteBasicsNode(sqlite3)\n    })\n});\n\nBecause the SQLite RxStorage is not free and you might not want to set up a FoundationDB cluster, there is also the option to use the LokiJS RxStorage together with the filesystem adapter. This will store the data as plain json in a file and load everything into memory on startup. This works great for small prototypes but it is not recommended to be used in production.\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb';\nconst LokiFsStructuredAdapter = require('lokijs/src/loki-fs-structured-adapter.js');\nimport { getRxStorageLoki } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-lokijs';\nimport sqlite3 from 'sqlite3';\nconst myRxDatabase = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'path/to/database/file/foobar.db',\n    storage: getRxStorageLoki({\n        adapter: new LokiFsStructuredAdapter()\n    })\n});\n\nHere is a performance comparison chart of the different storages (lower is better):\n\n  \n\n\n\nRxDB as Node.js In-Memory Database\nOne of the easiest way to use RxDB in Node.js is to use the Memory RxStorage. As the name implies, it stores the data directly in-memory of the Node.js JavaScript process. This makes it really fast to read and write data but of course the data is not persisted and will be lost when the nodejs process exits. Often the in-memory option is used when RxDB is used in unit tests because it automatically cleans up everything afterwards.\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb';\nimport { getRxStorageMemory } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-memory';\n\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'exampledb',\n    storage: getRxStorageMemory()\n});\n\nAlso notice that the default memory limit of Node.js is 4gb (might change of newer versions) so for bigger datasets you might want to increase the limit with the max-old-space-size flag:\n# increase the Node.js memory limit to 8GB\nnode --max-old-space-size=8192 index.js\n\nHybrid In-memory-persistence-synced storage\nIf you want to have the performance of an in-memory database but require persistency of the data, you can use the memory-synced storage. On database creation it will load all data into the memory and on writes it will first write the data into memory and later also write it to the persistent storage in the background. In the following example the FoundationDB storage is used, but any other RxStorage can be used as persistence layer.\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb';\nimport { getRxStorageFoundationDB } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-foundationdb';\nimport { getMemorySyncedRxStorage } from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-memory-synced';\n\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'exampledb',\n    storage: getMemorySyncedRxStorage({\n        storage: getRxStorageFoundationDB({\n            apiVersion: 620,\n            clusterFile: '/path/to/fdb.cluster'\n        })\n    })\n});\n\nWhile this approach gives you a database with great performance and persistent, it has two major downsides:\n\nThe database size is limited to the memory size\nWrites can be lost when the Node.js process exists between a write to the memory state and the background persisting.\n\nShare database between microservices with RxDB\nUsing a local, embedded database in Node.js works great until you have to share the data with another Node.js process or another server at all.\nTo share the database state with other instances, RxDB provides two different methods. One is replication and the other is the remote RxStorage.\nThe replication copies over the whole database set to other instances live-replicates all ongoing writes. This has the benefit of scaling better because each of your microservice will run queries on its own copy of the dataset.\nSometimes however you might not want to store the full dataset on each microservice. Then it is better to use the remote RxStorage and connect it to the \"main\" database. The remote storage will run all operations the main database and return the result to the calling database.\nFollow up on RxDB+Node.js\n\nCheck out the RxDB Nodejs example.\nIf you haven't done yet, you should start learning about RxDB with the Quickstart Tutorial.\nI created a list of embedded JavaSCript databases that you will help you to pick a database if you do not want to use RxDB.\n\n"},"questions-answers.html":{"url":"questions-answers.html","title":"Questions & Answers","keywords":"","body":"Questions and answers\nCan't change the schema of a collection\nWhen you make changes to the schema of a collection, you sometimes can get an error like\nError: addCollections(): another instance created this collection with a different schema.\nThis means you have created a collection before and added document-data to it.\nWhen you now just change the schema, it is likely that the new schema does not match the saved documents inside of the collection.\nThis would cause strange bugs and would be hard to debug, so RxDB check's if your schema has changed and throws an error.\nTo change the schema in production-mode, do the following steps:\n\nIncrease the version by 1\nAdd the appropriate migrationStrategies so the saved data will be modified to match the new schema\n\nIn development-mode, the schema-change can be simplified by one of these strategies:\n\nUse the memory-storage so your db resets on restart and your schema is not saved permanently\nCall removeRxDatabase('mydatabasename', RxStorage); before creating a new RxDatabase-instance\nAdd a timestamp as suffix to the database-name to create a new one each run like name: 'heroesDB' + new Date().getTime()\n\nWhy is the PouchDB RxStorage deprecated?\nWhen I started developing RxDB in 2016, I had a specific use case to solve.\nBecause there was no client-side database out there that fitted, I created\nRxDB as a wrapper around PouchDB. This worked great and all the PouchDB features\nlike the query engine, the adapter system, CouchDB-replication and so on, came for free.\nBut over the years, it became clear that PouchDB is not suitable for many applications,\nmostly because of its performance: To be compliant to CouchDB, PouchDB has to store all\nrevision trees of documents which slows down queries. Also purging these document revisions is not possible\nso the database storage size will only increase over time.\nAnother problem was that many issues in PouchDB have never been fixed, but only closed by the issue-bot like this one. The whole PouchDB RxStorage code was full of workarounds and monkey patches to resolve\nthese issues for RxDB users. Many these patches decreased performance even further. Sometimes it was not possible to fix things from the outside, for example queries with $gt operators return the wrong documents which is a no-go for a production database\nand hard to debug.\nIn version 10.0.0 RxDB introduced the RxStorage layer which\nallows users to swap out the underlying storage engine where RxDB stores and queries documents from.\nThis allowed to use alternatives from PouchDB, for example the Dexie RxStorage in browsers\nor even the FoundationDB RxStorage on the server side.\nThere where not many use cases left where it was a good choice to use the PouchDB RxStorage. Only replicating with a\nCouchDB server, was only possible with PouchDB. But this has also changed. RxDB has a plugin that allows\nto replicate clients with any CouchDB server by using the RxDB replication protocol. This plugins work with any RxStorage so that it is not necessary to use the PouchDB storage.\nRemoving PouchDB allows RxDB to add many awaited features like filtered change streams for easier replication and permission handling. It will also free up development time.\nIf you are currently using the PouchDB RxStorage, you have these options:\n\nMigrate to another RxStorage (recommended)\nNever update RxDB to the next major version (stay on \nFork the PouchDB RxStorage and maintain the plugin by yourself.\nFix all the PouchDB problems so that we can add PouchDB to the RxDB Core again.\n\n"},"contribute.html":{"url":"contribute.html","title":"Contribute","keywords":"","body":"Contribution\nWe are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community.\nDeveloping\nRequirements\nBefore you can start developing, do the following:\n\nMake sure you have installed nodejs with the version stated in the .nvmrc\nClone the repository git clone https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb.git\nInstall the dependencies cd rxdb && npm install\nMake sure that the tests work for you npm run test\n\nFlow\nWhile developing you should run npm run dev and leave it open in the console.

All minor changes can be found in the changelog.\nRemoving deprecated features\nThe PouchDB RxStorage was deprecated in 13 and has now finally been removed, see here.\nAlso the old replication-couchdb plugin was removed. Instead we had the replication-couchdb-new plugin which was now renamed to replication-couchdb.\nAPI changes\nRxDocument objects are now immutable\nAt the previous version of RxDB, RxDocuments mutate themself when they receive ChangeEvents from the database. For example when you have a document where name = 'foo' and some update changes the state to name = 'bar' in the database, then the previous JavaScript object changed its own property to the have doc.name === 'bar'.\nThis feature was great when you use a RxDocument with some change-detection like in angular or vue templates. You can use document properties directly in the template and all updates will be reflected in the view, without having to use observables or subscriptions.\nHowever this behavior is also confusing many times. When the state in the database is changed, it is not clear at which exact point of time the objects attribute changes. Also the self mutating behavior created some problem with vue- and react-devtools because of how they clone objects.\nIn RxDB v14, all RxDocuments are immutable. When you subscribe to a query and the same document is returned in the results, this will always be a new JavaScript object.\nAlso RxDocument.$ now emits RxDocument instances instead of the plain document data.\nRefactor findByIds()\nIn the past, the functions findByIds and findByIds$ directly returned the result set. This was confusing, instead they now return a RxQuery object that works exactly like any other database query.\nconst results = await myRxCollection.findByIds(['foo', 'bar']).exec();\nconst results$ = await myRxCollection.findByIds(['foo', 'bar']).$;\n\nRename to RxDocument update/modify functions\nRelated issue #4180.\nIn the past the naming of the document mutation methods is confusing.\nFor example update() works completely different to atomicUpdate() and so on.\nThe naming of all functions was unified and all methods do now have an incremental and a non-incremental version (previously known as atomic):\n\nRENAME atomicUpdate() to incrementalModify()\nRENAME atomicPatch() to incrementalPatch()\nRENAME atomicUpsert() to incrementalUpsert()\nADD RxDocument().incrementalUpdate()\nADD RxDocument.incrementalRemove()\nADD non-incremental RxDocument methods patch() and modify()\n\nReplication is started with a pure function\nIn the past, to start a replication, the replication plugin was added to RxDB and a method on the RxCollection was called like myRxCollection.syncGraphQL().\nThis caused many problems with tree shaking bailouts and having the correct typings.\nSo instead of having class method on the RxCollection, the replications are now started like:\nimport { replicateCouchDB } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication-couchdb';\nconst replicationState = replicateCouchDB({ /* ... */ });\n\nStorage plugins are prefixed with storage-\nFor better naming, all storage plugins have been prefixed with storage- so the imports have been changed:\n// Instead of \nimport { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/dexie';\n// it is now\nimport { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';\n\nEncryption plugin was renamed to encryption-crypto-js\nTo make it possible to have alternative encryption plugins, the encryption plugin was renamed to encryption-crypto-js.\n// Instead of \nimport { wrappedKeyEncryptionStorage } from 'rxdb/plugins/encryption';\n// it is now\nimport { wrappedKeyEncryptionCryptoJsStorage } from 'rxdb/plugins/encryption-crypto-js';\n\nRewrite the worker plugin\nIn the past, the worker plugin was based on the threads library. It was completely rewritten and uses the plain JavaScript API together with the remote storage plugin. BUT notice that the worker plugin has moved into the RxDB Premium package.\nPerformance improvements\nDo not use hash for revisions\nIn the past, the _rev field of a RxDocument dat was filled with a hash of the documents data. This was not the best solution because:\n\nHashing in JavaScript is slow, not running hashes on insert improves performance by about 33%\nWhen 2 clients do the exact same write to the document, it is not clear from comparing the document states because they will have the exact same hash which makes some conflict resolution strategies impossible to implement.\n\nInstead we now use just use the RxDatabase.token together with the revision height.\nBatch up incremental operations\nWhen making multiple writes to different (or the same) document, in the past RxDB made one write call to the storage. When doing fast writes, like when you writhe the current mouse position to a document, the writes could have queued up to the point where the users recognizes performance lag.\nIn RxDB v14, pending document updates are batched up into single storage writes for better performance.\nImproved tree shaking\nMany changes have been made to improve tree shakability of RxDB which results in smaller bundle sizes and a faster application startup.\nRefactor the document cache\nThe whole RxDocument cache was refactored. It now runs based on the WeakRef API and automatically cleans up cached documents that are no longer referenced. This reduces the use memory and makes RxDB more suitable for being used in Node.js on the server side.\nNotice that the WeakRef API is only featured in modern browsers so RxDB will no longer run on ie11.\nNo longer transpile some modern JavaScript features\nTo reduce the bundle size and improve performance, the following JavaScript features will no longer be transpiled because they are natively supported in modern browsers anyway:\n\nasync/await\nArrow functions\nfor...of\nshorthand properties\nSpread operator\ndestructuring\ndefault parameters\nobject spread\n\nAll these optimizations together reduced the test-bundle size from 74148 bytes down to 36007 bytes.\nOther changes\n\nADD push/pull.initialCheckpoint to start a replication from a given checkpoint.\nThe following plugins are out of beta mode:\nRxStorage Sharding\nRxStorage Remote\nRxStorage FoundationDB\nNew Replication CouchDB\nCleanup Plugin\n\n\n\nBugfixes\n\nCHANGE (memory RxStorage) do not clean up database state on closing of the storage, only on remove().\nFIX CouchDB replication: Use correct default fetch method.\nFIX schema hashing should respect the sort order #4005\nFIX replication does not provide a ._rev to the storage write when a conflict is resolved.\nFIX(remote storage) ensure caching works properly even on parallel create-calls\nFIX(replication) Composite Primary Keys broken on replicated collections #4190\nFIX(sqlite) $in Query not working SQLite #4278\nFIX CouchDB push is throwing error because of missing revision #4299\nADD dev-mode shows a console.warn() to ensure people do not use it in production.\nRemove the usage of Buffer.

To migrate stored data between the RxDB versions, therefore you have to increase your schema version by 1 and add a migration strategy.\nFor some storages, the stored data of the previous RxDB versions is not compatible with RxDB 14.0.0. So if you want to keep that data, you have to migrate it in a way. For most use cases you might want to just drop the data from the client and re-sync it again from the backend. To keep the data locally, you might want to use the storage migration plugin.\nYou can help!\nThere are many things that can be done by you to improve RxDB:\n\nCheck the BACKLOG for features that would be great to have.\nCheck the breaking backlog for breaking changes that must be implemented in the future but where I did not have the time yet.\nCheck the TODOs in the code. There are many small improvements that can be done for performance and build size.\nReview the code and add tests. I am only a single human with a laptop. My code is not perfect and much small improvements can be done when people review the code and help me to clarify undefined behaviors.\nUpdate the example projects many of them are outdated and need updates.\n\n"},"releases/13.0.0.html":{"url":"releases/13.0.0.html","title":"13.0.0","keywords":"","body":"13.0.0\nSo in the last major RxDB versions, the focus was set to improvements of the storage engine. This is done. RxDB has now multiple RxStorage implementations, a better query planner and an improved test suite to ensure everything works correct.\nThis let to huge improvements in write and query performance and decreased the initial pageload of RxDB based applications.\nIn the new major version 13.0.0, the focus was set to improvements to the replication protocol.\nWhen I first implemented the GraphQL replication a few years ago, I had a specific use case in mind and designed the whole protocol and replication plugins around that use case.\nBut the time has shown, that the old replication protocol is a big downside of RxDB:\n\nThe replication relied on the backend to solve all conflicts. This was easy to implement into RxDB because the whole     responsibility was given away to the person that has to implement a compatible backend.\nIn each point in time, the replication did either push or pull documents, but never in parallel. This slows done the whole replication process and makes RxDB not usable for the implementation of features like multi-user-real-time-collaboration or when many read- and write operations have to happen in a short timespan.\nAfter each push, a pull had to be run to check if the backend had changed the state to solve a conflict.\nThe replication protocol did not support attachments and was not designed to ever support them.\n\nSo in version 13.0.0 I replaced the whole replication plugins with a new replication protocol. The main goals have been:\n\nPush- and Pull in parallel.\nUse the data in the changestream (optional) to decrease replication latency.\nImplement the conflict resolution into RxDB so that the client resolves its own conflicts and does not rely on the backend.\nDecrease the complexity for a compatible backend implementation. The new protocol relies on a dumb backend. This will open compatibility with many other use cases like implementing Offline-First in Supabase or using CouchDB but having a faster replication compared to the native CouchDB replication.\nMake it possible to use CRDTs instead of a conflict resolution.\nDesign a the protocol in a way to make it possible to add attachments replication in the future.\n\nOn the RxDocument level, the replication works like git, where the fork/client contains all new writes and must be merged with the master/server before it can push its new state to the master/server.\nA---B1---C1---X    master/server state\n     \\       /\n      B1---C2      fork/client state\nFor more details, read the documentation about the new replication protocol.\nBackends that have been compatible with the previous RxDB versions 12 and older, will not work with the new replication protocol. To learn how to do that, either read the docs or check out the GraphQL example.\nOther breaking changes\n\nRENAMED the ajv-validate plugin to validate-ajv to be in equal with the other validation plugins.\nThe is-my-json-valid validation is no longer supported until this bug is fixed.\n\nREFACTORED the schema validation plugins, they are no longer plugins but now they get wrapped around any other RxStorage.\n\nIt allows us to run the validation inside of a Worker RxStorage instead of running it in the main JavaScript process.\nIt allows us to configure which RxDatabase instance must use the validation and which does not. In production it often makes sense to validate user data, but you might not need the validation for data that is only replicated from the backend.\n\n\nREFACTORED the key compression plugin, it is no longer a plugin but now a wrapper around any other RxStorage.\n\nIt allows to run the key-compression inside of a Worker RxStorage instead of running it in the main JavaScript process.\n\n\nREFACTORED the encryption plugin, it is no longer a plugin but now a wrapper around any other RxStorage.\n\nIt allows to run the encryption inside of a Worker RxStorage instead of running it in the main JavaScript process.\nIt allows do use asynchronous crypto function like WebCrypto\n\n\nStore the password hash in the same write request as the database token to improve performance.\n\nREMOVED support for temporary documents see here\n\nREMOVED RxDatabase.broadcastChannel The broadcast channel has been moved out of the RxDatabase and is part of the RxStorage. So it is not longer exposed via RxDatabase.broadcastChannel.\n\n\n\nRemoved the liveInterval option of the replication plugins. It was an edge case feature with wrong defaults. If you want to run the pull replication on interval, you can send a RESYNC event manually in a loop.\n\nREPLACED RxReplicationPullError and RxReplicationPushError with normal RxError like in the rest of the RxDB code.\n\nREMOVED the option to filter out replication documents with the push/pull modifiers #2552 because this does not work with the new replication protocol.\nCHANGE default of replication live to be set to true. Because most people want to do a live replication, not a one time replication.\n\nRENAMED the server plugin is now called server-couchdb and RxDatabase.server() is now RxDatabase.serverCouchDB()\n\nCHANGED Attachment data is now always handled as Blob because Node.js does support Blob since version 18.0.0 so we no longer have to use a Buffer but instead can use Blob for browsers and Node.js\n\nREFACTORED the layout of RxChangeEvent to better match the RxDB requirements and to fix the 'deleted-document-is-modified-but-still-deleted' bug.\n\n\nWhen used with Node.js, RxDB now requires Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher.\nOther non breaking or internal changes\n\nREMOVED many unused plugin hooks because they decreased the performance.\nREMOVE RxStorageStatics .hash and .hashKey\nCHANGE removed default usage of md5 as default hashing. Use a faster non-cryptographic hash instead.\nADD option to pass a custom hash function when calling createRxDatabase.\n\n\nCHANGE use Float instead of Int to represent timestamps in GraphQL.\n\nFIXED multiple problems with encoding attachments data. We now use the js-base64 library which properly handles utf-8/binary/ascii transformations.\n\nIn the RxDB internal _meta.lwt field, we now use 2 decimals number of the unix timestamp in milliseconds.\n\nADDED checkpointSchema to the RxStorage.statics interface.\n\nNew Features\n\nADDED the websocket replication plugin\nADDED the FoundationDB RxStorage\n\nMigration to the new version\nStored data of the previous RxDB versions is not compatible with RxDB 13.0.0. So if you want to keep that data, you have to migrate it in a way. For most use cases you might want to just drop the data from the client and re-sync it again from the backend. To keep the data locally, you might want to use the storage migration plugin.\n"},"releases/12.0.0.html":{"url":"releases/12.0.0.html","title":"12.0.0","keywords":"","body":"RxDB 12.0.0\nFor the last few months, I worked hard on the new RxDB version 12 release. I mostly focused on performance related features and refactored much of the code.\nRemoved the core plugin\nIn the past, RxDB exported all bundled plugins when doing import from 'rxdb';.\nThis increased the bundle size, so optionally people could import from 'rxdb/plugins/core'; to create a custom build that only contains the plugin that they really need.\nBut very often this lead to accidental imports of 'rxdb'. For example, when the code editor auto imported methods.\nSo now, the default import from 'rxdb'; only exports RxDB core. Every plugin must be imported afterwards if needed.\nUnified the replication primitives and the GraphQL replication plugin\nMost of the GraphQL replication code has been replaced by using the replication primitives plugin internally.\nThis means many bugs and undefined behavior that was already fixed in the replication primitives, are now also fixed in the GraphQL replication.\nAlso, the GraphQL replication now runs push in bulk. This means you either have to update your backend to accept bulk mutations, or set push.batchSize: 1 and transform the array into a single document inside push.queryBuilder().\nAdded the cleanup plugin\nTo make replication work, and for other reasons, RxDB has to keep deleted documents in storage.\nThis ensures that when a client is offline, the deletion state is still known and can be replicated with the backend when the client goes online again.\nKeeping too many deleted documents in the storage can slow down queries or fill up too much disk space.\nWith the cleanup plugin, RxDB will run cleanup cycles that clean up deleted documents when it can be done safely.\nAllow to set a specific index\nBy default, the query will be sent to RxStorage, where a query planner will determine which one of the available indexes must be used.\nBut the query planner cannot know everything and sometimes will not pick the most optimal index.\nTo improve query performance, you can specify which index must be used, when running the query.\nconst queryResults = await myCollection\n    .find({\n      selector: {\n        age: {\n          $gt: 18\n        },\n        gender: {\n          $eq: 'm'\n        }\n      },\n      /**\n       * Because the developer knows that 50% of the documents are 'male',\n       * but only 20% are below age 18,\n       * it makes sense to enforce using the ['gender', 'age'] index to improve performance.\n       * This could not be known by the query planner which might have chosen ['age', 'gender'] instead.\n       */\n      index: ['gender', 'age']\n    }).exec();\n\nEnforce primaryKey in the index\nFor various performance optimizations, like the EventReduce algorithm, RxDB needs a deterministic sort order for all query results.\nTo ensure a deterministic sorting, RxDB now automatically adds the primary key as last sort attribute to every query, if it is not there already. This ensures that all documents that have the same attributes on all query relevant fields, still can be sorted in a deterministic way, not depending on which was written first to the database.\nIn the past, this often lead to slow queries, because indexes where not constructed with that in mind.\nNow RxDB will add the primaryKey to all indexes that do not contain it already.\nIf you have any collection with a custom index set, you need to run a migration when updating to RxDB version 12.0.0 so that RxDB can rebuild the indexes.\nFields that are used in indexes need some meta attributes\nWhen using a schema with indexes, depending on the field type, you must have set some meta attributes like maxLength or minimum. This is required so that RxDB\nis able to know the maximum string representation length of a field, which is needed to craft custom indexes on several RxStorage implementations.\nconst schemaWithIndexes = {\n  version: 0,\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string',\n          maxLength: 100 // \nIntroduce _meta field\nIn the past, RxDB used a hacky way to mark documents as being from the remote instance during replication.\nThis is needed to ensure that pulled documents are not sent to the backend again.\nRxDB crafted a specific revision string and stored the data with that string.\nThis meant that it was not possible to replicate with multiple endpoints at the same time.\nFrom now on, all document data is stored with an _meta field that can contain various flags and other values.\nThis makes it easier for plugins to remember stuff that belongs to the document.\nIn the future, the other meta fields like _rev, _deleted and _attachments will be moved from the root level\nto the _meta field. This is not done in release 12.0.0 to ensure that there is a migration path.\nRemoved RxStorage RxKeyObjectInstance\nIn the past, we stored local documents and internal data in a RxStorageKeyObjectInstance of the RxStorage interface.\nIn PouchDB, this has a slight performance improvement compared to storing that data in 'normal' documents because it does not have to handle the revision tree.\nBut this improved performance is only possible because normal document handling on PouchDB is so slow.\nFor every other RxStorage implementation, it does not really mather if documents are stored in a query-able way or not. Therefore, the whole RxStorageKeyObjectInstance is removed. Instead, RxDB now stores local documents and internal data in normal storage instances. This removes complexity and makes things easier in the future. For example, we could now migrate local documents or query them in plugins.\nRefactor plugin hooks\nIn the past, an RxPlugin could add plugins hooks which where always added as last.\nThis meant that some plugins depended on having the correct order when calling addRxPlugin().\nNow each plugin hook can be either defined as before or after to specify at which position of the current hooks\nthe new hook must be added.\nLocal documents must be activated per RxDatabase/RxCollection\nFor better performance, the local document plugin does not create a storage for every database or collection that is created.\nInstead, you have to set localDocuments: true when you want to store local documents in the instance.\n// activate local documents on a RxDatabase\nconst myDatabase = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    storage: getRxStoragePouch('memory'),\n    localDocuments: true // \nAdded Memory RxStorage\nThe Memory RxStorage is based on plain in-memory arrays and objects. It can be used in all environments and is made for performance.\nRxDB Premium\nYou can now purchase access to additional RxDB plugins that are part of the RxDB Premium package.\nIf you have sponsored RxDB in the past (before the April 2022), you can get free lifetime access to RxDB Premium by writing me via Twitter\n\nRxStorage IndexedDB a really fast RxStorage implementation based on IndexedDB.

My code is not perfect and much small improvements can be done when people review the code and help me to clarify undefined behaviors.\nImprove the documentation. In the last user survey, many users told me that the documentation is not good enough. But I reviewed the docs and could not find clear flaws. The problem is that I am way too deep into RxDB so that I am not able to understand which documentation a newcomer to the project needs. Likely I assume too much knowledge or focus writing about the wrong parts.\nUpdate the example projects many of them are outdated and need updates.\nHelp the next PouchDB release to improve RxDBs performance.\n\n"},"releases/11.0.0.html":{"url":"releases/11.0.0.html","title":"11.0.0","keywords":"","body":"11.0.0\nThe last major release was only about 6 month ago. But to further improve RxDB, it was necessary to make some more breaking changes and release the next major version.\nIn the last version 10.0.0 the storage layer was abstracted in a way to make it possible to not only use PouchDB as storage, but instead we can use different storage engines like the one based on LokiJS or any custom implementation of the RxStorage interface.\nIn the new version 11.0.0 the focus is on making it possible to put the RxStorage into a WebWorker to take CPU load from the main process into the worker's process. This can improve the perceived performance of your application, especially when you have to handle many documents or when you need the main process CPU cycles to manage the DOM with your frontend framework.\nWorker plugin\nPerformance was always something RxDB had a struggle with. Not because RxDB itself is slow, but because the underlying storage engine (mostly PouchDB) or IndexedDB is slow. This never was a problem for 'normal' applications that have to store some documents. But on big applications with much data, there was a bottleneck.\nWith the Worker plugin, you can move the RxStorage out of the main JavaScript process. This makes it pretty easy to utilize more then one CPU core and speed up your application.\n// worker.ts\nimport { wrappedRxStorage } from 'rxdb/plugins/worker';\nimport { getRxStorageLoki } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-lokijs';\nwrappedRxStorage({\n    storage: getRxStorageLoki()\n});\n\n// main process\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb/plugins/core';\nimport { getRxStorageWorker } from 'rxdb/plugins/worker';\nconst database = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    storage: getRxStorageWorker(\n        {\n            statics: RxStorageLokiStatics,\n            workerInput: 'path/to/worker.js'\n        }\n    )\n});\n\nThe whole documentation about the worker plugin can be found here.\nTranspile async/await to promises instead of generators\nThe RxDB source-code is transpiled from TypeScript to es5/es6 JavaScript code via babel.\nIn the past we transpiled the async and await keywords with the babel plugin plugin-transform-async-to-generator.\nNow we use the babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises plugin instead.\nIt transpiles async/await into native Promises instead of using JavaScript generators. This has shown to decrease build size by about 10% and also improves the performance.\nRemoved deprecated received methods\nIn the past there was a typo in all getters and methods that are called received.\nThis was renamed to received and all mistyped methods have been deprecated.\nWe now removed all deprecated methods, so you have to use the correctly spelled methods instead.\nSee #3392\nAll internal events are handled as bulks\nAll events that are generated from writing to the storage instance are now handled in bulks instead of each event for its own. This has shown to save performance when the events are send over a data layer like a WebWorker or the BroadcastChannel. This change only affects you if you have created custom RxDB plugins.\nRxStorage interface changes\nTo make the RxStorage abstraction compatible with Webworkers, we had to do some changes. These will only affect you if you use a custom RxStorage implementation.\n\nThe non async functions prepareQuery, getSortComparator and getQueryMatcher have been moved out of RxStorageInstance into the statics property of RxStorage. This makes it possible to split the code when using the worker plugin. You only need to load the static methods at the main process, and the whole storage engine is only loaded inside of the worker.\nAll data communication with the RxStorage now happens only via plain JSON objects. Instead of returning a JavaScript Map or Set, only JSON datatypes are allowed. This makes it easier to properly serialize the data when transferring it over to or from a WebWorker.\nEvents that are created from a write operation, must be emitted before the write operation resolves. This ensures that RxDB always knows about all events before it runs another operation. So when you do an insert and a query directly after the insert, the query will return the correct results.\nThe meta data digest and length of attachments is now created by RxDB, not by the RxStorage. #3548\nAdded the statics hashKey property to identify the used hash function.\n\nRemoved the no-validate plugin.\nIn the past, RxDB required you to add one schema validation plugin. For production, it was useful to not have any schema validation for better performance and a smaller build size. For that, the no-validate plugin could be added which was just a dummy plugin that did no do any validation. To remove this unnecessary complexity, RxDB no longer requires you to add a validation plugin. Therefore the no-validate plugin is now removed as it is no longer needed.\nOther changes\n\nThe LokiJS RxStorage no longer uses the IdleQueue to determine if the database is idle. Because LokiJS is in-memory, we can just wait for CPU idleness via requestIdleCallback()\nBugfix: Do not throw an error when database is destroyed while a GraphQL replication is running.\nCompound primary key migration throws \"Value of primary key(s) cannot be changed\" #3546 Thanks @nothingkid\nAllow _id as primaryKey #3562 Thanks @SuperKirik\nLokiJS: Remote operations do never resolve when remote instance was leader and died.\n\nMigration from 10.x.x\nThe migration should be pretty easy. Nothing in the datalayer has been changed, so you can use the stored data of v10 together with the new v11 RxDB.\nYou can help!\nThere are many things that can be done by you to improve RxDB:\n\nCheck the BACKLOG for features that would be great to have.\nCheck the breaking backlog for breaking changes that must be implemented in the future but where I did not had the time yet.\nCheck the TODOs in the code.

The problem is that I am way to deep into RxDB so that I am not able to understand which documentation a newcomer to the project needs. Likely I assume too much knowledge or focus writing about the wrong parts.\nUpdate the example projects many of them are outdated and need updates.\n\nDiscuss!\nPlease discuss here.\n"},"releases/10.0.0.html":{"url":"releases/10.0.0.html","title":"10.0.0","keywords":"","body":"10.0.0\nOne year after version 9.0.0 we now have RxDB version 10.0.0.\nThe main goal of version 10 was to change things that make RxDB ready for the future.\nNotice that I use major releases to bundle stuff that breaks the RxDB usage in your project, not to add new features.\nThe main thing first\nIn the past, RxDB was build around Pouchdb. Before I started making RxDB I tried to solve the problems of my current project with other existing databases out there. I evaluated all of them and then started using Pouchdb and added many features via plugin. Then I realised it will be easier to create a separate project that wraps around Pouchdb, that was RxDB. Back then pouchdb was the most major browser database out there and it was well maintained and had a big community.\nBut in the last 5 years, things have changed. A big part of the RxDB users do not use couchdb in the backend and do not need the couchdb replication.\nTherefore they do not really need the overhead with revision handling that slows down the performance of pouchdb. Also there where many other problems with using pouchdb. It is not actively developed, many bugs are not fixed and no new features get added. Also there are many unsolved problems like how to finally delete document data or how to replicate more then 6 databases at the same time, how to use replication without attachments data, and so on...\nSo for this release, I abstracted all parts that we use from pouchdb into the RxStorage interface. RxDB works on top of any implementation of the RxStorage interface. This means it is now possible to use RxDB together with other underlying storages like SQLite, PostgreSQL, Minimongo, MongoDB, and so on, as long as someone writes the RxStorage class for it.\nThis means, to create a RxDatabase you have to pass the storage class instead of pouchdb specific settings:\n\n// import pouchdb specific stuff and add pouchdb adapters\nimport {\n    addPouchPlugin,\n    getRxStoragePouch\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/pouchdb';\n\n// IMPORTANT: Do not use addRxPlugin to add pouchdb adapter, instead use addPouchPlugin\naddPouchPlugin(require('pouchdb-adapter-memory'));\n\nimport {\n    addRxPlugin,\n    createRxDatabase,\n    randomCouchString,\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/core';\n\n// create the database with the storage creator.\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    storage: getRxStoragePouch('memory'),\n});\n\nTo access the internal pouch instance of a collection, you have to go over the storageInstance:\nconst pouch = myRxCollection.storageInstance.internals.pouch;\n\nOther breaking changes\nPrimary key is required\nIn the past, using a primary key was optional. When no primary key was defined, RxDB filled up the _id field with an uuid-like string which was then used as primary. When I researched on github how people use RxDB, I found out that many use a secondary index for what should be the primary key.\nAlso having the primary key optional, caused much confusing when using RxDB with typescript.\nSo now the primary key MUST be set when creating a schema for RxDB.\nAlso the primary key is defined with the primaryKey property at the top level of the schema. This ensures that typescript will complain if no primaryKey is defined.\n\n// when using the type `RxJsonSchema` the `DocType` is now required\nconst mySchema: RxJsonSchema = {\n    version: 0,\n    primaryKey: 'passportId',\n    type: 'object',\n    properties: {\n        passportId: {\n            type: 'string'\n        }\n    },\n    // primaryKey is always required\n    required: ['passportId']\n}\n\nAttachment data must be Blob or Buffer\nIn the past, an RxAttachment could be stored with Blob, Buffer and string data. If a string was passed, pouchdb internally transformed the data to a Blob or Buffer, depending on in which environment it is running.\nThis behavior caused much trouble and weird edge cases because of how the data is transformed from and to string.\nSo now you can only store Blob or Buffer as attachment data. string is no longer allowed. You can still transform a string to a Blob or Buffer by yourself and then store it.\nimport { blobBufferUtil } from 'rxdb';\n\nconst attachment = await myDocument.putAttachment(\n    {\n        id: 'cat.txt',\n        data: blobBufferUtil.createBlobBuffer('miau', 'text/plain')\n        type: 'text/plain'\n    }\n);\n\nAlso putAttachment() now defaults to skipIfSame=true. This means when you write attachment data that already is exactly the same in the database, no write will be done.\nOutgoing data is now readonly and deep-frozen\nRxDB often uses outgoing data also in the internals. For example the result of a query is not only send to the user, but also used inside of RxDB's query-change-detection. To ensure that mutation of the outgoing data is not changing internal stuff, which would cause strange bugs, outgoing data was always deep-cloned before handing it out to the user. This is a common practice on many javascript libraries.\nThe problem is that deep-cloning big objects can be very CPU/Memory expensive. So instead of doing a deep-clone, RxDB does now assume that outgoing data is immutable. If the users wants to modify that data, it has be be deep-cloned by the user.\nTo ensure immutability, RxDB runs a deep-freeze in the dev-mode (about same expensive as deep clone). Also typescript will throw a build-time error because we use ReadonlyArray and readonly to define outgoing data immutable. In production-mode, there will be nothing besides typescript that ensures immutability to have best performance.\nconst data = myRxDocument.toJSON();\ndata.foo = bar; // This does NOT work!\n\n// instead clone the data before changing it\nimport { clone } from 'rxjs';\nconst clonedData = clone(data);\ndata.foo = bar; // This works!\n\nThe in-memory plugin does no longer work.\nThe in-memory plugin was used to spawn in-memory collections on top of a normal RxCollection. The benefit is to have the data replicated into the memory of the javascript runtime, which allows for faster queries.\nAfter doing many tests and observations, I found out that the in-memory plugin was slow. Really slow, even slower then just using the indexeddb adapter in the browser. You can reproduce my observations at the event-reduce testpage. Here you can see that random-writes+query are slower on the memory-adapter then on indexeddb.\nThe reason for this are the big abstraction layers. Pouchdb uses the adapter system. The memory adapter uses the leveldown abstraction layer. Each write/read goes to the memdown module.\nSo the in-memory plugin is not working for now. In the future it will be reimplemented in a custom memory based RxStorage class.\nNotice: You can of course still use the pouchdb memory adapter as usual. It is not affected by this change.\nWhat else is a breaking change?\n\nRemoved the deprecated atomicSet(), use atomicPatch() instead.\nRemoved the deprecated RxDatabase.collection() use RxDatabase().addCollections() instead.\nRemoved plugin hook preCreatePouchDb because it is no longer needed.\nRemoved the watch-for-changes plugin. We now overwrite pouchdbs bulkDocs method to generate events. This is faster and more reliable.\nRemoved the adapter-check plugin. (The function adapterCheck is move to the pouchdb plugin).\nCalling RxDatabase.server() now returns a promise that resolves when the server is started up.\nChanged the defaults of PouchDBExpressServerOptions from the server() method, by default we now store logs in the tmp folder and the config is in memory.\nRenamed replication-plugin to replication-couchdb to be more consistent in naming like with replication-graphql\nFor the same reason, renamed RxCollection().sync() to RxCollection().syncCouchDB()\n\n\nRenamed the functions of the json import/export plugin to be less confusing.\ndump() is now exportJSON()\nimportDump() is now importJSON()\n\n\nRxCollection uses a separate pouchdb instance for local documents, so that they can persist during migrations.\nA JsonSchema must have the required array at the top level and it must contain the primary key.\n\nNew features\nComposite primary key\nYou can now use a composite primary key for the schema where you can join different properties of the document data to create a primary key.\nconst mySchema = {\n  keyCompression: true, // set this to true, to enable the keyCompression\n  version: 0,\n  title: 'human schema with composite primary',\n  primaryKey: {\n      // where should the composed string be stored\n      key: 'id',\n      // fields that will be used to create the composed key\n      fields: [\n          'firstName',\n          'lastName'\n      ],\n      // separator which is used to concat the fields values.\n      separator: '|'\n  }\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      firstName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      lastName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      }\n  },\n  required: [\n    'id', \n    'firstName',\n    'lastName'\n  ]\n};\n\nFor the future\nWith these changes, RxDB is now ready for the future plans:\n\nI want to replace the revision handling of documents with conflict resolution strategies that can always directly resolve conflicts instead of maintaining the revision tree.\nImplement different implementations for RxStorage. I will first work on a memory based version. I am in good hope that the community will create other implementations depending on their needs.\n\nYou can help!\nThere are many things that can be done by you to improve RxDB:\n\nCheck the BACKLOG for features that would be great to have.\nCheck the breaking backlog for breaking changes that must be implemented in the future but where I did not had the time yet.\nCheck the TODOs in the code. There are many small improvements that can be done for performance and build size.\nReview the code and add tests. I am only a single dude with a laptop. My code is not perfect and much small improvements can be done when people review the code and help me to clarify undefined behaviors.\nImprove the documentation. In the last user survey many users told me that the documentation is not good enough. But I reviewed the docs and could not find clear flaws. The problem is that I am way to deep into RxDB so that I am not able to understand which documentation a newcomer to the project needs. Likely I assume too much knowledge or focus writing about the wrong parts.\nUpdate the example projects many of them are outdated and need updates.\n\nDiscuss!\nPlease discuss here.\n"},"releases/9.0.0.html":{"url":"releases/9.0.0.html","title":"9.0.0","keywords":"","body":"9.0.0\nSo I was working hard the past month to prepare everything for the next major release of RxDB. The last major release was 1,5 years ago by the way.\nWhen I started listing up the planned changes I had big ambitions about basically rewriting everything. But I found out this time has not come yet. There is some work to be done first. So version 9.0.0 was more about fixing all these small things that made improving the codebase difficult. Much has been refactored and moved. Some API-parts have been changed to have a more simple project with a cleaner codebase.\nNotice that I use major releases to bundle stuff that breaks the RxDB usage in your project. By having only few major releases you can be sure that you can upgrade in one big block instead of changing stuff each few months. Big features are released in non-major releases because they mostly can be implemented without side effects.\nBreaking changes\nYou have to apply these changes to your codebase when upgrading RxDB.\nAll default exports have been removed\nUsing default exports and imports can be helpful when you want to write code fast.\nBut using them also disabled the tree-shaking of your bundler which means you added much code to your bundle that was not even used. To prevent this common behavior, I removed all default exports and renamed functions so that they are more unlikely to clash with other non-RxDB function names.\nInstead of doing\nimport RxDB from 'rxdb';\nRxDB.plugin(/* ... */);\nawait RxDB.create({/* ... */});\n\nYou now do\nimport { createRxDatabase, addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\naddRxPlugin(/* ... */);\nawait createRxDatabase({/* ... */});\n\nAlso removeDatabase() is renamed to removeRxDatabase() and plugin() is now addRxPlugin().\nSame goes for all previous default exports of the plugins.\nIndexes are specified at the top level of the schema definition\nrelated issue\nIn the past the indexes of a collection had to be specified at the field level of the schema like \n{\n    \"firstName\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"index\": true\n    }    \n}\n\nThis made it complex to list up the index fields which had a bad performance on startup.\nTo fix this the indexes are now specified at the top level of the schema like\n{\n    \"title\": \"my schema\",\n    \"version\": 0,\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {},\n    \"indexes\": [\n        \"firstName\",\n        [\"compound\", \"index\"]\n    ]\n}\n\nEncrypted fields at the top level of the schema\nSame as the indexes, encrypted fields are now also defined in the top level like\n{\n    \"title\": \"my schema\",\n    \"version\": 0,\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {},\n    \"encrypted\": [\n        \"password\"\n    ]\n}\n\nNew dev-mode plugin\nIn the past we had stuff that is only wanted for development in the two plugins error-messages and schema-check.\nNow we have a single plugin dev-mode that contains all these checks and development helper functions. I also moved many other checks out of the core-module into dev-mode.\nimport { RxDBDevModePlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/dev-mode';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBDevModePlugin);\n\nNew migration plugin\nThe data migration was not used by all users of this project. Often it was easier to just wipe the local data store and let the client sync everything from the server. Because the migration has so much code, it is now in a separate plugin so that you do not have to ship this code to the clients if not necessary.\nimport { RxDBMigrationPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/migration';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBMigrationPlugin);\n\nRewritten key-compression\nThe key-compression logic was fully coded only for RxDB. This was a problem because it was not usable for other stuff and also badly tested. We had a known problem with nested arrays that caused much confusion because some queries did not find the correct documents.\nI now created a npm-package jsonschema-key-compression that has cleaner code, better tests and can also be used for non-RxDB stuff.\nIf you used the key-compression in the past and have clients out there with old data, you have to find a way to migrate that data by using the json-import or other solutions depending on your project.\nRewritten query-change-detection to event-reduce\nOne big benefit of having a realtime database is that big performance optimizations can be done when the database knows a query is observed and the updated results are needed continuously. In the past this optimization was done by the internal queryChangeDetection which was a big tree of if-else-statements that hopefully worked. This was also the reason why queryChangeDetection was in beta mode and not enabled by default.\nAfter months of research and testing I was able to create Event-Reduce: An algorithm to optimize database queries that run multiple times. This JavaScript module contains an algorithm that is able to optimize realtime queries in a way that was not possible before. The algorithm is not RxDB specific and also heavily tested.\nInstead of setting queryChangeDetection when creating a RxDatabase, you now set eventReduce which defaults to true.\nfind() and findOne() now accepts the full mango query\nIn the past, only the selector of a query could be passed to find() and findOne() if you wanted to also do sort, skip or limit, you had to call additional functions like\nconst query = myRxCollection.find({\n    age: {\n        $gt: 10\n    }\n}).sort('name').skip(5).limit(10);\n\nNow you can pass the full query to the function call like \nconst query = myRxCollection.find({\n    selector: {\n        age: {\n            $gt: 10\n        }\n    },\n    sort: [{name: 'asc'}],\n    skip: 5,\n    limit: 10\n});\n\nmoved query builder to own plugin\nThe query builder that allowed to create queries like .where('foo').eq('bar') etc. was not really used by many people. Most of the time it is better to just pass the full query as simple json object. Also the code for the query builder was big and increased the build size much more then its value added. Only some edge-cases where recursive query modification was needed made the query builder useful. If you still want to use the query builder, you have to import the plugin.\nimport { RxDBQueryBuilderPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/query-builder';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBQueryBuilderPlugin);\n\nRefactored RxChangeEvent\nThe whole data structure of RxChangeEvent was way more complicated than it had to be. I refactored the whole class to be more simple. If you directly use RxChangeEvent in your project you have to adapt to these changes. Also the stream of RxDatabase().$ will no longer emit the COLLECTION event when a new collection is created.\nInternal hash() is now using a salt\nThe internal hash function was used to store hashes of database passwords to compare them and directly throw errors when the wrong password was used with an existing data set. This was dangerous because you could use rainbow tables or even just google the hash to find out the plain password. So now the internal hashing is using a salt to prevent these attacks. If you have used the encryption in the past, you have to migrate your internal schema storage.\nChanged default of RxDocument.toJSON()\nBy default RxDocument.toJSON() always returned also the _rev field and the _attachments. This was confusing behavior which is why I changed the default to RxDocument().toJSON(withRevAndAttachments = false)\nTypescript 3.8.0 or newer is required\nBecause RxDB and some subdependencies extensively use export type ... you now need typescript 3.8.0 or newer.\nGraphQL replication will run a schema validation of incoming data\nIn dev-mode, the GraphQL-replication will run a schema validation of each document that comes from the server before it is saved to the database.\nInternal and other changes\nI refactored much internal stuff and moved much code out of the core into the specific plugins.\n\nRenamed RxSchema.jsonID to RxSchema.jsonSchema\nMoved remaining stuff of leader-election from core into the plugin\nMerged multiple internal databases for metadata into one internalStore\nRemoved many runtime type checks that now should be covered by typescript in buildtime\nThe GraphQL replication is now out of beta mode\nRemoved documentation examples for require() CommonJS loading\nRemoved RxCollection.docChanges$() because all events are from the docs\n\nHelp wanted\nRxDB is an open source project an heavily relies on the contribution of its users. There are some things that must be done, but I have no time for them.\nRefactor data-migrator\nThe current implementation has some flaws and should be completely rewritten.\n\nIt does not use pouchdb's bulkDocs which is much faster\nIt could have been written without rxjs and with less code that is easier to understand\nIt does not migrate the revisions of documents which causes a problem when replication is used\n\nAdd e2e tests to the react example\nThe react example has no end-to-end tests which is why the CI does not ensure that it works all the time. We should add some basic tests like we did for the other example projects.\nFix pouchdb bug so we can upgrade pouchdb-find\nThere is a bug in pouchdb that prevents the upgrade of pouchdb-find. This is why RxDB relies on an old version of pouchdb-find that also requires different sub-dependencies. This increases the build size a lot because for example we ship multiple version of spark-md5 and others.\nAbout the future of RxDB\nAt the moment RxDB is a realtime database based on pouchdb. In the future I want RxDB to be a wrapper around pull-based databases that also works with other source-dbs like mongoDB or PostgreSQL. As a start I defined the RxStorage interface and created a RxStoragePouchdb class that implements it and contains all pouchdb-specific logic. I want to move every direct storage usage into that interface so that later we can create other implementations of it for other source databases.\n"},"releases/8.0.0.html":{"url":"releases/8.0.0.html","title":"8.0.0","keywords":"","body":"8.0.0\nWhen I created RxDB, two years ago, there where some things that I did not consider and other things that I just decided wrong.\nWith the breaking version 8.0.0 I rewrote some parts of RxDB and changed the API a bit. The focus laid on better defaults and better performance.\ndisableKeyCompression by default\nBecause the keyCompression was confusing and most users do not use it, it is now disabled by default. Also the naming was bad, so disableKeyCompression is now renamed to keyCompression which defaults to false.\ncollection() now only accepts a RxJsonSchema as schema\nIn the past, it was allowed to set an RxSchema or an RxJsonSchema as schema-field when creating a collection. This was confusing and so it is now only allowed to use RxJsonSchema.\nrequired fields have to be set via array\nIn the past it was allowed to set a field as required by setting the boolean value required: true.\nThis is against the json-schema-standard and will make problems when switching between different schema-validation-plugins. Therefore required fields must now be set via required: ['fieldOne', 'fieldTwo'].\nSetters are only callable on temporary documents\nTo be similar to mongoosejs, there was the possibility to set a documents value via myDoc.foo = 'bar' and later call myDoc.save() to persist these changes.\nBut there was the problem that we have no weak pointers in javascript and therefore we have to store all document-instances in a cache to run change-events on them and make them 'reactive'. To save memory-space, we reuse the same documents when they are used multiple times. This made it hard to determine what happens when multiple parts of an application used the setters at the same time. Also there was an undefined behavior what should happen when a field is changed via setter and also via replication before save() was called.\n\nmyDoc.age = 50;, myDoc.set('age', 50); and myDoc.save() is no more allowed on non-temporary-documents\nInstead, to change document-data, use RxDocument.atomicUpdate() or RxDocument.atomicSet() or RxDocument.update().\nThe following document-methods no longer exist: synced$, resync()\n\nmiddleware-hooks contain plain json as first parameter and RxDocument as second\nWhen the middleware-hooks where created, the goal was to work equal then mongoose. But this is not possible because mongoose is more 'static' and its documents never change their attributes. RxDB is a reactive database and when the state on disc changes, the attributes of the document also change. This caused some undefined behavior especially with async middleware-hooks. To solve this, hooks now can only modify the plain data, not the RxDocument itself.\nmyCollection.preSave(function(data, rxDocument) {\n    // to set age to 50 before saving, change the first parameter\n    data.age = 50;\n}, false);\n\nmultiInstance is now done via broadcast-channel\nBecause the BroadcastChannel-API is not usable in all browsers and also not in NodeJs, multiInstance-communication was hard. The hacky workaround was to use a pseudo-socket and regularly check if an other instance has emitted a RxChangeEvent.\nThis was expensive because even when the database did nothing, we wasted disk-IO and CPU by handling this.\nTo solve this waste, I spend one month creating a module that polyfills the broadcast-channel-api so it works on old browsers, new browsers and even NodeJs. This does not only waste less resources but also has a lower latency. Also the module is used by more projects than RxDB which allows use the fix bugs and improve performance together.\nSet QueryChangeDetection via RxDatabase-option\nIn the past, the QueryChangeDetection had to be enabled by importing the QueryChangeDetection and calling a function on it. This was strange and also did not allow to toggle the QueryChangeDetection on specific databases.\nNow we set the QueryChangeDetection by adding the boolean field queryChangeDetection: true when creating the database.\nconst db = await RxDB.create({\n  name: 'heroesdb',\n  adapter: 'idb',\n  queryChangeDetection: false // \nReuse an RxDocument-prototype per collection instead of adding getters/setters to each document\nBecause the fields of an RxDocument are defined dynamically by the schema and we could not use the Proxy-Object because it is not supported in IE11, there was one workaround used: Each time a document is created, all getters and setters where applied on it. This was expensive and now we use a different approach.\nOnce per collection, a custom RxDocument-prototype and constructor is created and each RxDocument of this collection is created with the constructor. This change is a rewrite internally and should not change anything for RxDB-users. If you use RxDB with vuejs, you might get some problems that can be fixed by upgrading vuejs to the latest version.\nRewritten the inMemory-plugin\nThe inMemory-plugin was written with some wrong estimations. I rewrote it and added much more tests. Also awaitPersistence() can now be used to check if all writes have already been replicated into the parent collection. Also RxCollection.watchForChanges() got split out from the replication-plugin into its own watch-for-changes-plugin because it is used in the inMemory and the replication functionality.\nSome comparisons\n(Tested with node 10.6.0 and the memory-adapter, lower is better)\nReproduce with npm run build:size and npm run test:performance\n\n\n\n\n7.7.1\n8.0.0\n\n\n\n\nBundle-Size (Webpack+minify+gzip)\n110 kb\n101.962 kb\n\n\nSpawn 1000 databases  with 5 collections each\n8744 ms\n9906 ms\n\n\ninsert 2000 documents\n8006 ms\n5781 ms\n\n\nfind 10.000 documents\n3202 ms\n1312 ms\n\n\n\n"},"offline-first.html":{"url":"offline-first.html","title":"Offline First","keywords":"","body":"Offline First\nOffline-First (aka local first) is a software paradigm where the software must work as well offline as it does online.\nTo implement this, you have to store data at the client side, so that your application can still access it when the internet goes away.\nThis can be either done with complex caching strategies, or by using an offline first database (like RxDB) that stores the data inside of IndexedDb and replicates it from and to the backend in the background. This makes the local database, not the server, the gateway for all persistent changes in application state.\n\nOffline first is not about having no internet connection\n\nWhile in the past, internet connection was an unstable, things are changing especially for mobile devices.\nMobile networks become better and having no internet becomes less common even in remote locations.\nSo if we did not care about offline first applications in the past, why should we even care now?\nIn the following I will point out why offline first applications are better, not because they support offline usage, but because of other reasons.\nUX is better without loading spinners\nIn 'normal' web applications, most user interactions like fetching, saving or deleting data, correspond to a request to the backend server. This means that each of these interactions require the user to await the unknown latency to and from a remote server while looking at a loading spinner.\nIn offline-first apps, the operations go directly against the local storage which happens almost instantly. There is no perceptible loading time and so it is not even necessary to implement a loading spinner at all. As soon as the user clicks, the UI represents the new state as if it was already changed in the backend.\n\n  \n\n\nMulti-tab usage just works\nMany, even big websites like amazon, reddit and stack overflow do not handle multi tab usage correctly. When a user has multiple tabs of the website open and does a login on one of these tabs, the state does not change on the other tabs.\nOn offline first applications, there is always exactly one state of the data across all tabs. Offline first databases (like RxDB) store the data inside of IndexedDb and share the state between all tabs of the same origin.\n\n  \n\n\nLatency is more important than bandwidth\nIn the past, often the bandwidth was the limiting factor on determining the loading time of an application.\nBut while bandwidth has improved over the years, latency became the limiting factor.\nYou can always increase the bandwidth by setting up more cables or sending more Starlink satellites to space.\nBut reducing the latency is not so easy. It is defined by the physical properties of the transfer medium, the speed of light and the distance to the server. All of these three are hard to optimize.\nOffline first application benefit from that because sending the initial state to the client can be done much faster with more bandwidth. And once the data is there, we do no longer have to care about the latency to the backend server.\n\n  \n\n\n\nRealtime comes for free\nMost websites lie to their users. They do not lie because they display wrong data, but because they display old data that was loaded from the backend at the time the user opened the site.\nTo overcome this, you could build a realtime website where you create a websocket that streams updates from the backend to the client. This means work. Your client needs to tell the server which page is currently opened and which updates the client is interested to. Then the server can push updates over the websocket and you can update the UI accordingly.\nWith offline first applications, you already have a realtime replication with the backend. Most offline first databases provide some concept of changestream or data subscriptions and with RxDB you can even directly subscribe to query results or single fields of documents. This makes it easy to have an always updated UI whenever data on the backend changes.\n\n  \n\n\n\nScales with data size, not with the amount of user interaction\nOn normal applications, each user interaction can result in multiple requests to the backend server which increase its load.\nThe more users interact with your application, the more backend resources you have to provide.\nOffline first applications do not scale up with the amount of user actions but instead they scale up with the amount of data.\nOnce that data is transferred to the client, the user can do as many interactions with it as required without connecting to the server.\nModern apps have longer runtimes\nIn the past you used websites only for a short time. You open it, perform some action and then close it again. This made the first load time the important metric when evaluating page speed.\nToday web applications have changed and with it the way we use them. Single page applications are opened once and then used over the whole day. Chat apps, email clients, PWAs and hybrid apps. All of these were made to have long runtimes.\nThis makes the time for user interactions more important than the initial loading time. Offline first applications benefit from that because there is often no loading time on user actions while loading the initial state to the client is not that relevant.\nYou might not need REST\nOn normal web applications, you make different requests for each kind of data interaction.\nFor that you have to define a swagger route, implement a route handler on the backend and create some client code to send or fetch data from that route. The more complex your application becomes, the more REST routes you have to maintain and implement.\nWith offline first apps, you have a way to hack around all this cumbersome work. You just replicate the whole state from the server to the client. The replication does not only run once, you have a realtime replication and all changes at one side are automatically there on the other side. On the client, you can access every piece of state with a simple database query.\nWhile this of course only works for amounts of data that the client can load and store, it makes implementing prototypes and simple apps much faster.\nYou might not need Redux\nData is hard, especially for UI applications where many things can happen at the same time.\nThe user is clicking around. Stuff is loaded from the server. All of these things interact with the global state of the app.\nTo manage this complexity it is common to use state management libraries like Redux or MobX. With them, you write all this lasagna code to wrap the mutation of data and to make the UI react to all these changes.\nOn offline first apps, your global state is already there in a single place stored inside of the local database.\nYou do not have to care whether this data came from the UI, another tab, the backend or another device of the same user. You can just make writes to the database and fetch data out of it.\n\n"},"downsides-of-offline-first.html":{"url":"downsides-of-offline-first.html","title":"Downsides of Offline First","keywords":"","body":"Downsides of Offline First\nSo you have read all these things about how the offline first paradigm makes it easy to create realtime web applications that even work when the user has no internet connection.\nBut there is no free lunch. The offline first paradigm is not the perfect approach for all kinds of apps.\n\nYou fully understood a technology when you know when not to use it\n\nIn the following I will point out the limitations you need to know before you decide to use RxDB or even before you decide to create an offline first application.\nIt only works with small datasets\nMaking data available offline means it must be loaded from the server and then stored at the clients device.\nYou need to load the full dataset on the first pageload and on every ongoing load you need to download the new changes to that set.\nWhile in theory you could download in infinite amount of data, in practice you have a limit how long the user can wait before having an up-to-date state.\nYou want to display chat messages like Whatsapp? No problem. Syncing all the messages a user could write, can be done with a few HTTP requests.\nWant to make a tool that displays server logs? Good luck downloading terabytes of data to the client just to search for a single string. This will not work.\nBesides the network usage, there is another limit for the size of your data.\nIn browsers you have some options for storage: Cookies, Localstorage, WebSQL and IndexedDB.\nBecause Cookies and Localstorage is slow and WebSQL is deprecated, you will use IndexedDB.\nThe limit of how much data you can store in IndexedDB depends on two factors: Which browser is used and how much disc space is left on the device. You can assume that at least a couple of hundred megabytes are available at least. The maximum is potentially hundreds of gigabytes or more, but the browser implementations vary. Chrome allows the browser to use up to 60% of the total disc space per origin. Firefox allows up to 50%. But on safari you can only store up to 1GB and the browser will prompt the user on each additional 200MB increment.\nThe problem is, that you have no chance to really predict how much data can be stored. So you have to make assumptions that are hopefully true for all of your users. Also, you have no way to increase that space like you would add another hard drive to your backend server. Once your clients reach the limit, you likely have to rewrite big parts of your applications.\nBrowser storage is not really persistent\nWhen data is stored inside IndexedDB or one of the other storage APIs, it cannot be trusted to stay there forever.\nApple for example deletes the data when the website was not used in the last 7 days. The other browsers also have logic to clean up the stored data, and in the end the user itself could be the one that deletes the browsers local data.\nThe most common way to handle this, is to replicate everything from the backend to the client again.\nOf course, this does not work for state that is not stored at the backend. So if you assume you can store the users private data inside the browser in a secure way, you are wrong.\n\n  \n\n\nThere can be conflicts\nImagine two of your users modify the same JSON document, while both are offline. After they go online again, their clients replicate the modified document to the server. Now you have two conflicting versions of the same document, and you need a way to determine how the correct new version of that document should look like. This process is called conflict resolution.\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe default in many offline first databases is a deterministic conflict resolution strategy. Both conflicting versions of the document are kept in the storage and when you query for the document, a winner is determined by comparing the hashes of the document and only the winning document is returned. Because the comparison is deterministic, all clients and servers will always pick the same winner. This kind of resolution only works when it is not that important that one of the document changes gets dropped. Because conflicts are rare, this might be a viable solution for some use cases.\n\nA better resolution can be applied by listening to the changestream of the database. The changestream emits an event each time a write happens to the database. The event contains information about the written document and also a flag if there is a conflicting version. For each event with a conflict, you fetch all versions for that document and create a new document that contains the winning state. With that you can implement pretty complex conflict resolution strategies, but you have to manually code it for each collection of documents.\n\nInstead of the solving conflict once at every client, it can be made a bit easier by solely relying on the backend. This can be done when all of your clients replicate with the same single backend server. With RxDB's Graphql Replication each client side change is sent to the server where conflicts can be resolved and the winning document can be sent back to the clients.\n\nSometimes there is no way to solve a conflict with code. If your users edit text based documents or images, often only the users themselves can decide how the winning revision has to look. For these cases, you have to implement complex UI parts where the users can inspect the conflict and manage its resolution.\n\nYou do not have to handle conflicts if they cannot happen in the first place. You can achieve that by designing a write only database where existing documents cannot be touched. Instead of storing the current state in a single document, you store all the events that lead to the current state. Sometimes called the \"everything is a delta\" strategy, others would call it Event Sourcing. Like an accountant that does not need an eraser, you append all changes and afterwards aggregate the current state at the client.\n// create one new document for each change to the users balance\n{id: new Date().toJSON(), change: 100} // balance increased by $100\n{id: new Date().toJSON(), change: -50} // balance decreased by $50\n{id: new Date().toJSON(), change: 200} // balance increased by $200\n\n\nThere is this thing called conflict-free replicated data type, short CRDT. Using a CRDT library like automerge will magically solve all of your conflict problems. Until you use it in production where you observe that implementing CRDTs has basically the same complexity as implementing conflict resolution strategies.\n\n\nRealtime is a lie\nSo you replicate stuff between the clients and your backend. Each change on one side directly changes the state of the other sides in realtime. But this \"realtime\" is not the same as in realtime computing. In the offline first world, the word realtime was introduced by firebase and is more meant as a marketing slogan than a technical description.\nThere is an internet between your backend and your clients and everything you do on one machine takes at least once the latency until it can affect anything on the other machines. You have to keep this in mind when you develop anything where the timing is important, like a multiplayer game or a stock trading app.\nEven when you run a query against the local database, there is no \"real\" realtime.\nClient side databases run on JavaScript and JavaScript runs on a single CPU that might be partially blocked because the user is running some background processes. So you can never guarantee a response deadline which violates the time constraint of realtime computing.\n\n  \n\n\nEventual consistency\nAn offline first app does not have a single source of truth. There is a source on the backend, one on the own client, and also each other client has its own definition of truth. At the moment your user starts the app, the local state is hopefully already replicated with the backend and all other clients. But this does not have to be true, the states can have converged and you have to plan for that.\nThe user could update a document based on wrong assumptions because it was not fully replicated at that point in time because the user is offline. A good way to handle this problem is to show the replication state in the UI and tell the user when the replication is running, stopped, paused or finished.\nAnd some data is just too important to be \"eventual consistent\". Create a wire transfer in your online banking app while you are offline. You keep the smartphone laying at your night desk and when you use again in the next morning, it goes online and replicates the transaction. No thank you, do not use offline first for these kind of things, or at least you have to display the replication state of each document in the UI.\n\n  \n\n\n\nPermissions and authentication\nEvery offline first app that goes beyond a prototype, does likely not have the same global state for all of its users. Each user has a different set of documents that are allowed to be replicated or seen by the user. So you need some kind of authentication and permission handling to divide the documents.\nThe easy way is to just create one database for each user on the backend and only allow to replicate that one. Creating that many databases is not really a problem with for example CouchDB, and it makes permission handling easy.\nBut as soon as you want to query all of your data in the backend, it will bite back. Your data is not at a single place, it is distributed between all of the user specific databases. This becomes even more complex as soon as you store information together with the documents that is not allowed to be seen by outsiders. You not only have to decide which documents to replicate, but also which fields of them.\nSo what you really want is a single datastore in the backend and then replicate only the allowed document parts to each of the users.\nThis always requires you to implement your custom replication endpoint like what you do with RxDBs GraphQL Replication.\nYou have to migrate the client database\nWhile developing your app, sooner or later you want to change the data layout. You want to add some new fields to documents or change the format of them. So you have to update the database schema and also migrate the stored documents.\nWith 'normal' applications, this is already hard enough and often dangerous. You wait until midnight, stop the webserver, make a database backup, deploy the new schema and then you hope that nothing goes wrong while it updates that many documents.\nWith offline first applications, it is even more fun. You do not only have to migrate your local backend database, you also have to provide a migration strategy for all of these client databases out there. And you also cannot migrate everything at the same time. The clients can only migrate when the new code was updated from the appstore or the user visited your website again. This could be today or in a few weeks.\nPerformance is not native\nWhen you create a web based offline first app, you cannot store data directly on the users filesystem. In fact there are many layers between your JavaScript code and the filesystem of the operation system. Let's say you insert a document in RxDB:\n\nYou call the RxDB API to validate and store the data\nRxDB calls the underlying RxStorage, for example PouchDB.\nPouchdb calls its underlying storage adapter\nThe storage adapter calls IndexedDB\nThe browser runs its internal handling of the IndexedDB API\nIn most browsers IndexedDB is implemented on top of SQLite\nSQLite calls the OS to store the data in the filesystem\n\nAll these layers are abstractions. They are not build for exactly that one use case, so you lose some performance to tunnel the data through the layer itself, and you also lose some performance because the abstraction does not exactly provide the functions that are needed by the layer above and it will overfetch data.\nYou will not find a benchmark comparison between how many transactions per second you can run on the browser compared to a server based database. Because it makes no sense to compare them. Browsers are slower, JavaScript is slower.\n\nIs it fast enough?\n\nWhat you really care about is \"Is it fast enough?\". For most use cases, the answer is yes. Offline first apps are UI based and you do not need to process a million transactions per second, because your user will not click the save button that often. \"Fast enough\" means that the data is processed in under 16 milliseconds so that you can render the updated UI in the next frame. This is of course not true for all use cases, so you better think about the performance limit before starting with the implementation.\nNothing is predictable\nYou have a PostgreSQL database and run a query over 1000ths of rows, which takes 200 milliseconds. Works great, so you now want to do something similar at the client device in your offline first app. How long does it take? You cannot know because people have different devices, and even equal devices have different things running in the background that slow the CPUs. So you cannot predict performance and as described above, you cannot even predict the storage limit. So if your app does heavy data analytics, you might better run everything on the backend and just send the results to the client.\nThere is no relational data\nI started creating RxDB many years ago and while still maintaining it, I often worked with all these other offline first databases out there. RxDB and all of these other ones, are based on some kind of document databases similar to NoSQL. Often people want to have a relational database like the SQL one they use at the backend. \nSo why are there no real relations in offline first databases? I could answer with these arguments like how JavaScript works better with document based data, how performance is better when having no joins or even how NoSQL queries are more composable. But the truth is, everything is NoSQL because it makes replication easy. An SQL query that mutates data in different tables based on some selects and joins, cannot be partially replicated without breaking the client. You have foreign keys that point to other rows and if these rows are not replicated yet, you have a problem. To implement a robust replication protocol for relational data, you need some stuff like a reliable atomic clock and you have to block queries over multiple tables while a transaction replicated. Watch this guy implementing offline first replication on top of SQLite or read this discussion about implementing offline first in supabase.\nSo creating replication for an SQL offline first database is way more work than just adding some network protocols on top of PostgreSQL. It might not even be possible for clients that have no reliable clock.\n\n  \n\n\n"},"slow-indexeddb.html":{"url":"slow-indexeddb.html","title":"Slow IndexedDB","keywords":"","body":"Why IndexedDB is slow and what to use instead\nSo you have a JavaScript web application that needs to store data at the client side, either to make it offline usable, just for caching purposes or for other reasons.\nFor in-browser data storage, you have some options:\n\nCookies are sent with each HTTP request, so you cannot store more then a few strings in them.\nWebSQL is deprecated because it never was a real standard and turning it into a standard would have been too difficult.\nLocalStorage is a synchronous API over asynchronous IO-access. Storing and reading data can fully block the JavaScript process so you cannot use LocalStorage for more then few simple key-value pairs.\nThe FileSystem API could be used to store plain binary files, but it is only supported in chrome for now.\nIndexedDB is an indexed key-object database. It can store json data and iterate over its indexes. It is widely supported and stable.\n\nUPDATE April 2023: Since beginning of 2023, all modern browsers ship the File System Access API which allows to persistently store data in the browser with a way better performance. For RxDB you can use the OPFS RxStorage to get about 4x performance improvement compared to IndexedDB.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nIt becomes clear that the only way to go is IndexedDB. You start developing your app and everything goes fine.\nBut as soon as your app gets bigger, more complex or just handles more data, you might notice something. IndexedDB is slow. Not slow like a database on a cheap server, even slower! Inserting a few hundred documents can take up several seconds. Time which can be critical for a fast page load. Even sending data over the internet to the backend can be faster then storing it inside of an IndexedDB database.\n\nTransactions vs Throughput\n\nSo before we start complaining, lets analyze what exactly is slow. When you run tests on Nolans Browser Database Comparison you can see that inserting 1k documents into IndexedDB takes about 80 milliseconds, 0.08ms per document. This is not really slow. It is quite fast and it is very unlikely that you want to store that many document at the same time at the client side. But the key point here is that all these documents get written in a single transaction.\nI forked the comparison tool here and changed it to use one transaction per document write. And there we have it. Inserting 1k documents with one transaction per write, takes about 2 seconds. Interestingly if we increase the document size to be 100x bigger, it still takes about the same time to store them. This makes clear that the limiting factor to IndexedDB performance is the transaction handling, not the data throughput.\n\n  \n\n\nTo fix your IndexedDB performance problems you have to make sure to use as less data transfers/transactions as possible.\nSometimes this is easy, as instead of iterating over a documents list and calling single inserts, with RxDB you could use the bulk methods to store many document at once.\nBut most of the time is not so easy. Your user clicks around, data gets replicated from the backend, another browser tab writes data. All these things can happen at random time and you cannot crunch all that data in a single transaction.\nAnother solution is to just not care about performance at all. In a few releases the browser vendors will have optimized IndexedDB and everything is fast again. Well, IndexedDB was slow in 2013 and it is still slow today. If this trend continues, it will still be slow in a few years from now. Waiting is not an option. The chromium devs made a statement to focus on optimizing read performance, not write performance.\nSwitching to WebSQL (even if it is deprecated) is also not an option because, like the comparison tool shows, it has even slower transactions.\nSo you need a way to make IndexedDB faster. In the following I lay out some performance optimizations than can be made to have faster reads and writes in IndexedDB.\nHINT: You can reproduce all performance tests in this repo. In all tests we work on a dataset of 40000 human documents with a random age between 1 and 100.\nBatched Cursor\nWith IndexedDB 2.0, new methods were introduced which can be utilized to improve performance. With the getAll() method, a faster alternative to the old openCursor() can be created which improves performance when reading data from the IndexedDB store.\nLets say we want to query all user documents that have an age greater then 25 out of the store.\nTo implement a fast batched cursor that only needs calls to getAll() and not to getAllKeys(), we first need to create an age index that contains the primary id as last field.\nmyIndexedDBObjectStore.createIndex(\n    'age-index',\n    [\n        'age',\n        'id'\n    ]\n);\n\nThis is required because the age field is not unique, and we need a way to checkpoint the last returned batch so we can continue from there in the next call to getAll().\nconst maxAge = 25;\nlet result = [];\nconst tx: IDBTransaction = db.transaction([storeName], 'readonly', TRANSACTION_SETTINGS);\nconst store = tx.objectStore(storeName);\nconst index = store.index('age-index');\nlet lastDoc;\nlet done = false;\n/**\n * Run the batched cursor until all results are retrieved\n * or the end of the index is reached.\n */\nwhile (done === false) {\n    await new Promise((res, rej) => {\n        const range = IDBKeyRange.bound(\n          /**\n           * If we have a previous document as checkpoint,\n           * we have to continue from it's age and id values.\n           */\n            [\n                lastDoc ? lastDoc.age : -Infinity,\n                lastDoc ? lastDoc.id : -Infinity,\n            ],\n            [\n                maxAge + 0.00000001,\n                String.fromCharCode(65535)\n            ],\n            true,\n            false\n        );\n        const openCursorRequest = index.getAll(range, batchSize);\n        openCursorRequest.onerror = err => rej(err);\n        openCursorRequest.onsuccess = e => {\n            const subResult: TestDocument[] = e.target.result;\n            lastDoc = lastOfArray(subResult);\n            if (subResult.length === 0) {\n                done = true;\n            } else {\n                result = result.concat(subResult);\n            }\n            res();\n        };\n    });\n}\nconsole.dir(result);\n\n\n  \n\n\nAs the performance test results show, using a batched cursor can give a huge improvement. Interestingly choosing a high batch size is important. When you known that all results of a given IDBKeyRange are needed, you should not set a batch size at all and just directly query all documents via getAll().\nRxDB uses batched cursors in the IndexedDB RxStorage.\nIndexedDB Sharding\nSharding is a technique, normally used in server side databases, where the database is partitioned horizontally. Instead of storing all documents at one table/collection, the documents are split into so called shards and each shard is stored on one table/collection. This is done in server side architectures to spread the load between multiple physical servers which increases scalability.\nWhen you use IndexedDB in a browser, there is of course no way to split the load between the client and other servers. But you can still benefit from sharding. Partitioning the documents horizontally into multiple IndexedDB stores, has shown to have a big performance improvement in write- and read operations while only increasing initial pageload slightly.\n\n  \n\n\nAs shown in the performance test results, sharding should always be done by IDBObjectStore and not by database. Running a batched cursor over the whole dataset with 10 store shards in parallel is about 28% faster then running it over a single store. Initialization time increases minimal from 9 to 17 milliseconds.\nGetting a quarter of the dataset by batched iterating over an index, is even 43% faster with sharding then when a single store is queried.\nAs downside, getting 10k documents by their id is slower when it has to run over the shards.\nAlso it can be much effort to recombined the results from the different shards into the required query result. When a query without a limit is done, the sharding method might cause a data load huge overhead.\nSharding can be used with RxDB with the Sharding Plugin.\nCustom Indexes\nIndexes improve the query performance of IndexedDB significant. Instead of fetching all data from the storage when you search for a subset of it, you can iterate over the index and stop iterating when all relevant data has been found.\nFor example to query for all user documents that have an age greater than 25, you would create an age+id index.\nTo be able to run a batched cursor over the index, we always need our primary key (id) as the last index field.\nInstead of doing this, you can use a custom index which can improve the performance. The custom index runs over a helper field ageIdCustomIndex which is added to each document on write. Our index now only contains a single string field instead of two (age-number and id-string).\n// On document insert add the ageIdCustomIndex field.\nconst idMaxLength = 20; // must be known to craft a custom index  \ndocData.ageIdCustomIndex = docData.age + docData.id.padStart(idMaxLength, ' ');\nstore.put(docData);\n// ...\n\n// normal index\nmyIndexedDBObjectStore.createIndex(\n    'age-index',\n    [\n        'age',\n        'id'\n    ]\n);\n\n// custom index\nmyIndexedDBObjectStore.createIndex(\n    'age-index-custom',\n    [\n        'ageIdCustomIndex'\n    ]\n);\n\nTo iterate over the index, you also use a custom crafted keyrange, depending on the last batched cursor checkpoint. Therefore the maxLength of id must be known.\n// keyrange for normal index\nconst range = IDBKeyRange.bound(\n    [25, ''],\n    [Infinity, Infinity],\n    true,\n    false\n);\n\n// keyrange for custom index\nconst range = IDBKeyRange.bound(\n    // combine both values to a single string\n    25 + ''.padStart(idMaxLength, ' '),\n    Infinity,\n    true,\n    false\n);\n\n\n  \n\n\nAs shown, using a custom index can further improve the performance of running a batched cursor by about 10%.\nAnother big benefit of using custom indexes, is that you can also encode boolean values in them, which cannot be done with normal IndexedDB indexes.\nRxDB uses custom indexes in the IndexedDB RxStorage.\nRelaxed durability\nChromium based browsers allow to set durability to relaxed when creating an IndexedDB transaction. Which runs the transaction in a less secure durability mode, which can improve the performance.\n\nThe user agent may consider that the transaction has successfully committed as soon as all outstanding changes have been written to the operating system, without subsequent verification.\n\nAs shown here, using the relaxed durability mode can improve performance slightly. The best performance improvement could be measured when many small transactions have to be run. Less, bigger transaction do not benefit that much.\nExplicit transaction commits\nBy explicitly committing a transaction, another slight performance improvement can be achieved. Instead of waiting for the browser to commit an open transaction, we call the commit() method to explicitly close it.\n// .commit() is not available on all browsers, so first check if it exists.\nif (transaction.commit) {\n    transaction.commit()\n}\n\nThe improvement of this technique is minimal, but observable as these tests show.\nIn-Memory on top of IndexedDB\nTo prevent transaction handling and to fix the performance problems, we need to stop using IndexedDB as a database. Instead all data is loaded into the memory on the initial page load. Here all reads and writes happen in memory which is about 100x faster. Only some time after a write occurred, the memory state is persisted into IndexedDB with a single write transaction. In this scenario IndexedDB is used as a filesystem, not as a database.\nThere are some libraries that already do that:\n\nLokiJS with the IndexedDB Adapter\nAbsurd-SQL\nSQL.js with the empscripten Filesystem API\nDuckDB Wasm\n\nIn-Memory: Persistence\nOne downside of not directly using IndexedDB, is that your data is not persistent all the time. And when the JavaScript process exists without having persisted to IndexedDB, data can be lost. To prevent this from happening, we have to ensure that the in-memory state is written down to the disc. One point is make persisting as fast as possible. LokiJS for example has the incremental-indexeddb-adapter which only saves new writes to the disc instead of persisting the whole state. Another point is to run the persisting at the correct point in time. For example the RxDB LokiJS storage persists in the following situations:\n\nWhen the database is idle and no write or query is running. In that time we can persist the state if any new writes appeared before.\nWhen the window fires the beforeunload event we can assume that the JavaScript process is exited any moment and we have to persist the state. After beforeunload there are several seconds time which are sufficient to store all new changes. This has shown to work quite reliable.\n\nThe only missing event that can happen is when the browser exists unexpectedly like when it crashes or when the power of the computer is shut of.\nIn-Memory: Multi Tab Support\nOne big difference between a web application and a 'normal' app, is that your users can use the app in multiple browser tabs at the same time. But when you have all database state in memory and only periodically write it to disc, multiple browser tabs could overwrite each other and you would loose data. This might not be a problem when you rely on a client-server replication, because the lost data might already be replicated with the backend and therefore with the other tabs. But this would not work when the client is offline.\nThe ideal way to solve that problem, is to use a SharedWorker. A SharedWorker is like a WebWorker that runs its own JavaScript process only that the SharedWorker is shared between multiple contexts. You could create the database in the SharedWorker and then all browser tabs could request the Worker for data instead of having their own database. But unfortunately the SharedWorker API does not work in all browsers. Safari dropped its support and InternetExplorer or Android Chrome, never adopted it. Also it cannot be polyfilled. UPDATE: Apple added SharedWorkers back in Safari 142\nInstead, we could use the BroadcastChannel API to communicate between tabs and then apply a leader election between them. The leader election ensures that, no matter how many tabs are open, always one tab is the Leader.\n\n  \n\n\nThe disadvantage is that the leader election process takes some time on the initial page load (about 150 milliseconds). Also the leader election can break when a JavaScript process is fully blocked for a longer time. When this happens, a good way is to just reload the browser tab to restart the election process.\nUsing a leader election is implemented in the RxDB LokiJS Storage.\nFurther read\n\nOffline First Database Comparison\nSpeeding up IndexedDB reads and writes\nSQLITE ON THE WEB: ABSURD-SQL\nSQLite in a PWA with FileSystemAccessAPI\nResponse to this article by Oren Eini\n\n"},"why-nosql.html":{"url":"why-nosql.html","title":"Why NoSQL","keywords":"","body":"\n\n\n\n\nWhy UI applications need NoSQL\nRxDB, a client side, offline first, JavaScript database, is now several years old.\nOften new users appear in the chat and ask for that one simple feature:\nThey want to store and query relational data.\n\nSo why not just implement SQL?\n\nAll these client databases out there have on some kind of document based, NoSQL like, storage engine. PouchDB, Firebase, AWS Datastore, RethinkDB's Horizon, Meteor's Minimongo, Parse, Realm. They all do not have real relational data.\nThey might have some kind of weak relational foreign keys like the RxDB Population\nor the relational models of AWS Datastore.\nBut these relations are weak. The foreign keys are not enforced to be valid like in PostgreSQL, and you cannot query\nthe rows with complex subqueries over different tables or collections and then make mutations based on the result.\nThere must be a reason for that. In fact, there are multiple of them and in the following I want to show you why you can neither have, nor want real relational data when you have a client-side database with replication.\n\n  \n\n\n\nTransactions do not work with humans involved\nOn the server side, transactions are used to run steps of logic inside of a self contained unit of work. The database system ensures that multiple transactions do not run in parallel or interfere with each other.\nThis works well because on the server side you can predict how longer everything takes. It can be ensured that one transactions does not block everything else for too long which would make the system not responding anymore to other requests.\nWhen you build a UI based application that is used by a real human, you can no longer predict how long anything takes.\nThe user clicks the edit button and expects to not have anyone else change the document while the user is in edit mode.\nUsing a transaction to ensure nothing is changed in between, is not an option because the transaction could be open for a long\ntime and other background tasks, like replication, would no longer work.\nSo whenever a human is involved, this kind of logic has to be implemented using other strategies. Most NoSQL databases like RxDB or CouchDB use a system based on revision and conflicts to handle these.\nTransactions do not work with offline-first\nWhen you want to build an offline-first application, it is assumed that the user can also read and write data, even when the device has lost the connection to the backend.\nYou could use database transactions on writes to the client's database state, but enforcing a transaction boundary across other instances like clients or servers, is not possible when there is no connection.\n\n  \n\n\nOn the client you could run an update query where all color: red rows are changed to color: blue, but this would not guarantee that there will still be other red documents when the client goes online again and restarts the replication with the server. \nUPDATE docs\nSET docs.color = 'red'\nWHERE docs.color = 'blue';\n\nRelational queries in NoSQL\nWhat most people want from a relational database, is to run queries over multiple tables.\nSome people think that they cannot do that with NoSQL, so let me explain.\nLet's say you have two tables with customers and cities where each city has an id and each customer has a city_id. You want to get every customer that resides in Tokyo. With SQL, you would use a query like this:\nSELECT *\nFROM city\nWHERE city.name = 'Tokyo'\nLEFT JOIN customer ON customer.city_id = city.id;\n\nWith NoSQL you can just do the same, but you have to write it manually:\nconst cityDocument = await db.cities.findOne().where('name').equals('Tokyo').exec();\nconst customerDocuments = await db.customers.find().where('city_id').equals(cityDocument.id).exec();\n\nSo what are the differences? The SQL version would run faster on a remote database server because it would aggregate all data there and return only the customers as result set. But when you have a local database, it is not really a difference. Querying the two tables by hand would have about the same performance as a JavaScript implementation of SQL that is running locally.\nThe main benefit from using SQL is, that the SQL query runs inside of a single transaction. When a change to one of our two tables happens, while our query runs, the SQL database will ensure that the write does not affect the result of the query. This could happen with NoSQL, while you retrieve the city document, the customer table gets changed and your result is not correct for the dataset that was there when you started the querying. As a workaround, you could observe the database for changes and if a change happened in between, you have to re-run everything.\n\n  \n\n\n\nReliable replication\nIn an offline first app, your data is replicated from your backend servers to your users and you want it to be reliable.\nThe replication is reliable when, no matter what happens, every online client is able to run a replication\nand end up with the exact same database state as any other client.\nImplementing a reliable replication protocol is hard because of the circumstances of your app:\n\nYour users have unknown devices.\nThey have an unknown internet speed.\nThey can go offline or online at any time.\nClients can be offline for a several days with un-synced changes.\nYou can have many users at the same time.\nThe users can do many database writes at the same time to the same entities.\n\nNow lets say you have a SQL database and one of your users, called Alice, runs a query that mutates some rows, based on a condition.\n# mark all items out of stock as inStock=FALSE\nUPDATE\n  Table_A\nSET\n  Table_A.inStock = FALSE\nFROM\n  Table_A\nWHERE\n  Table_A.amountInStock = 0\n\nAt first, the query runs on the local database of Alice and everything is fine.\nBut at the same time Bob, the other client, updates a row and sets amountInStock from 0 to 1.\nNow Bob's client replicates the changes from Alice and runs them. Bob will end up with a different database state than Alice because on one of the rows, the WHERE condition was not met. This is not what we want, so our replication protocol should be able to fix it. For that it has to reduce all mutations into a deterministic state.\nLet me loosely describe how \"many\" SQL replications work:\nInstead of just running all replicated queries, we remember a list of all past queries. When a new query comes in that happened before our last query, we roll back the previous queries, run the new query, and then re-execute our own queries on top of that. For that to work, all queries need a timestamp so we can order them correctly. But you cannot rely on the clock that is running at the client. Client side clocks drift, they can run in a different speed or even a malicious client modifies the clock on purpose. So instead of a normal timestamp, we have to use a Hybrid Logical Clock that takes a client generated id and the number of the clients query into account. Our timestamp will then look like 2021-10-04T15:29.40.273Z-0000-eede1195b7d94dd5. These timestamps can be brought into a deterministic order and each client can run the replicated queries in the same order. Watch this video to learn how to implement that.\nWhile this sounds easy and realizable, we have some problems:\nThis kind of replication works great when you replicate between multiple SQL servers. It does not work great when you replicate between a single server and many clients.\n\nAs mentioned above, clients can be offline for a long time which could require us to do many and heavy rollbacks on each client when someone comes back after a long time and replicates the change.\nWe have many clients where many changes can appear and our database would have to roll back many times.\nDuring the rollback, the database cannot be used for read queries.\nIt is required that each client downloads and keeps the whole query history.\n\nWith NoSQL, replication works different. A new client downloads all current documents and each time a document changes, that document is downloaded again. Instead of replicating the query that leads to a data change, we just replicate the changed data itself. Of course, we could do the same with SQL and just replicate the affected rows of a query, like WatermelonDB does it. This was a clever way to go for WatermelonDB, because it was initially made for React Native and did want to use the fast SQLite instead of the slow AsyncStorage. But in a more general view, it defeats the whole purpose of having a replicating relational database because you have transactions locally, but these transactions become meaningless as soon as the data goes through the replication layer.\n\n  \n\n\n\nServer side validation\nWhenever there is client-side input, it must be validated on the server.\nOn a NoSQL database, validating a changed document is trivial. The client sends the changed document to the server, and the server can then check if the user was allowed to modify that one document and if the applied changes are ok.\nSafely validating a SQL query is up to impossible.\n\nYou first need a way to parse the query with all this complex SQL syntax and keywords.\nYou have to ensure that the query does not DOS your system.\nThen you check which rows would be affected when running the query and if the user was allowed to change them\nThen you check if the mutation to that rows are valid.\n\nFor simple queries like an insert/update/delete to a single row, this might be doable. But a query with 4 LEFT JOIN will be hard.\nEvent optimization\nWith NoSQL databases, each write event always affects exactly one document. This makes it easy to optimize the processing of events at the client. For example instead of handling multiple updates to the same document, when the user comes online again, you could skip everything but the last event.\nSimilar to that you can optimize observable query results. When you query the customers table you get a query result of 10 customers. Now a new customer is added to the table and you want to know how the new query results look like. You could analyze the event and now you know that you only have to add the new customer to the previous results set, instead of running the whole query again. These types of optimizations can be run with all NoSQL queries and even work with limit and skip operators. In RxDB this all happens in the background with the EventReduce algorithm that calculates new query results on incoming changes.\nThese optimizations do not really work with relational data. A change to one table could affect a query to any other tables. and you could not just calculate the new results based on the event. You would always have to re-run the full query to get the updated results.\nMigration without relations\nSooner or later you change the layout of your data. You update the schema and you also have to migrate the stored rows/documents. In NoSQL this is often not a big deal because all of your documents are modeled as self containing piece of data. There is an old version of the document and you have a function that transforms it into the new version.\nWith relational data, nothing is self-contained. The relevant data for the migration of a single row could be inside any other table. So when changing the schema, it will be important which table to migrate first and how to orchestrate the migration or relations.\nOn client side applications, this is even harder because the client can close the application at any time and the migration must be able to continue.\nEverything can be downgraded to NoSQL\nTo use an offline first database in the frontend, you have to make it compatible with your backend APIs.\nMaking software things compatible often means you have to find the lowest common denominator.\nWhen you have SQLite in the frontend and want to replicate it with the backend, the backend also has to use SQLite. You cannot even use PostgreSQL because it has a different SQL dialect and some queries might fail. But you do not want to let the frontend dictate which technologies to use in the backend just to make replication work.\nWith NoSQL, you just have documents and writes to these documents. You can build a document based layer on top of everything by removing functionality. It can be built on top of SQL, but also on top of a graph database or even on top of a key-value store like levelDB or FoundationDB.\nWith that document layer you can build a replication API that serves documents sorted by the last update time and there you have a realtime replication.\nCaching query results\nMemory is limited and this is especially true for client side applications where you never know how much free RAM the device really has. You want to have a fast realtime UI, so your database must be able to cache query results.\nWhen you run a SQL query like SELECT .. the result of it can be anything. An array, a number, a string, a single row, it depends on how the query goes on. So the caching strategy can only be to keep the result in memory, once for each query.\nThis scales very bad because the more queries you run, the more results you have to store in memory.\nWhen you make a query to a NoSQL collection, you always know how the result will look like. It is a list of documents, based on the collection's schema (if you have one). The result set is stored in memory, but because you get similar documents for different queries to the same collection, we can de-duplicated the documents. So when multiple queries return the same document, we only have it in the cache once and each query caches point to the same memory object. So no matter how many queries you make, your cache maximum is the collection size.\nTypeScript support\nModern web apps are build with TypeScript and you want the transpiler to know the types of your query result so it can give you build time errors when something does not match. This is quite easy on document based systems. The typings of for each document of a collection can be generated from the schema, and all queries to that collection will always return the given document type. With SQL you have to manually write the typings for each query by hand because it can contain all these aggregate functions that affect the type of the query's result.\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhat you lose with NoSQL\n\nYou can not run relational queries across tables inside a single transaction.\nYou can not mutate documents based on a WHERE clause, in a single transaction.\nYou need to resolve replication conflicts on a per-document basis.\n\nBut there is database XY\nYes, there are SQL databases out there that run on the client side or have replication, but not both.\n\nWebSQL / sql.js: In the past there was WebSQL in the browser. It was a direct mapping to SQLite because all browsers used the SQLite implementation. You could store relational data in it, but there was no concept of replication at any point in time. sql.js is an SQLite complied to JavaScript. It has not replication and it has (for now) no persistent storage, everything is stored in memory.\nWatermelonDB is a SQL databases that runs in the client. WatermelonDB uses a document-based replication that is not able to replicate relational queries.\nCockroach / Spanner/ PostgreSQL etc. are SQL databases with replication. But they run on servers, not on clients, so they can make different trade offs.\n\nFurther read\n\nCockroach Labs: Living Without Atomic Clocks\nTransactions, Conflicts and Revisions in RxDB\nWhy MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase, DynamoDB, and Riak will only let you perform transactions on a single data item\n\nMake a PR to this file if you have more interesting links to that topic\n\n\n"},"alternatives.html":{"url":"alternatives.html","title":"Alternatives","keywords":"","body":"Alternatives for realtime offline-first JavaScript applications\nTo give you an augmented view over the topic of client side JavaScript databases, this page contains all known alternatives to RxDB.

So it makes only sense to list similar projects as alternatives, not just any database or JavaScript store library. However, I will list up some projects that RxDB is often compared with, even if it only makes sense for some use cases.\nThis list should be seen as an entrypoint for your personal evaluation of which tool could work for your project.\n\n\nFirebase\n\n  \n\n\nFirebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. Firebase has many features and products, two of which are client side databases. The Realtime Database and the Cloud Firestore.\nFirebase - Realtime Database\nThe firebase realtime database was the first database in firestore. It has to be mentioned that in this context, \"realtime\" means \"realtime replication\", not \"realtime computing\". The firebase realtime database stores data as a big unstructured JSON tree that is replicated between clients and the backend.\nFirebase - Cloud Firestore\nThe firestore is the successor to the realtime database. The big difference is that it behaves more like a 'normal' database that stores data as documents inside of collections. The conflict resolution strategy of firestore is always last-write-wins which might or might not be suitable for your use case.\nThe biggest difference to RxDB is that firebase products are only able to be used on top of the Firebase cloud hosted backend, which creates a vendor lock-in. RxDB can replicate with any self hosted CouchDB server or custom GraphQL endpoints. You can even replicate Firestore to RxDB with the Firestore Replication Plugin.\nMeteor\n\n  \n\n\nMeteor (since 2012) is one of the oldest technologies for JavaScript realtime applications. Meteor is not a library but a whole framework with its own package manager, database management and replication protocol.\nBecause of how it works, it has proven to be hard to integrate it with other modern JavaScript frameworks like angular, vue.js or svelte.\nMeteor uses MongoDB in the backend and can replicate with a Minimongo database in the frontend.\nWhile testing, it has proven to be impossible to make a meteor app offline first capable. There are some projects that might do this, but all are unmaintained.\nMinimongo\nForked in Jan 2014 from meteorJSs' minimongo package, Minimongo is a client-side, in-memory, JavaScript version of MongoDB with backend replication over HTTP. Similar to MongoDB, it stores data in documents inside of collections and also has the same query syntax. Minimongo has different storage adapters for IndexedDB, WebSQL, LocalStorage and SQLite.\nCompared to RxDB, Minimongo has no concept of revisions or conflict handling, which might lead to undefined behavior when used with replication or in multiple browser tabs. Minimongo has no observable queries or changestream.\nWatermelonDB\n\n  \n\n\nWatermelonDB is a reactive & asynchronous JavaScript database. While originally made for React and React Native, it can also be used with other JavaScript frameworks. The main goal of WatermelonDB is performance within an application with lots of data.\nIn React Native, WatermelonDB uses the provided SQLite database. In a browser, LokiJS can be used to store and query data.\nAWS Amplify\n\n  \n\n\nAWS Amplify is a collection of tools and libraries to develop web- and mobile frontend applications. Similar to firebase, it provides everything needed like authentication, analytics, a REST API, storage and so on. Everything hosted in the AWS Cloud, even when they state that \"AWS Amplify is designed to be open and pluggable for any custom backend or service\". For realtime replication, AWS Amplify can connect to an AWS App-Sync GraphQL endpoint.\nAWS Datastore\nSince december 2019 the Amplify library includes the AWS Datastore which is a document-based, client side database that is able to replicate data via AWS AppSync in the background.\nThe main difference to other projects is the complex project configuration via the amplify cli and the bit confusing query syntax that works over functions. Complex Queries with multiple OR/AND statements are not possible which might change in the future.\nLocal development is hard because the AWS AppSync mock does not support realtime replication. It also is not really offline-first because a user login is always required.\n// An AWS datastore OR query\nconst posts = await DataStore.query(Post, c => c.or(\n  c => c.rating(\"gt\", 4).status(\"eq\", PostStatus.PUBLISHED)\n));\n\n// An AWS datastore SORT query\nconst posts = await DataStore.query(Post, Predicates.ALL, {\n  sort: s => s.rating(SortDirection.ASCENDING).title(SortDirection.DESCENDING)\n});\n\nThe biggest difference to RxDB is that you have to use the AWS cloud backends. This might not be a problem if your data is at AWS anyway.\nRethinkDB\n\n  \n\n\nRethinkDB is a backend database that pushed dynamic JSON data to the client in realtime. It was founded in 2009 and the company shut down in 2016.\nRethink db is not a client side database, it streams data from the backend to the client which of course does not work while offline.\nHorizon\nHorizon is the client side library for RethinkDB which provides useful functions like authentication, permission management and subscription to a RethinkDB backend. Offline support never made it to horizon.\nSupabase\n\n  \n\n\n\nSupabase labels itself as \"an open source Firebase alternative\". It is a collection of open source tools that together mimic many Firebase features, most of them by providing a wrapper around a PostgreSQL database. While it has realtime queries that run over the wire, like with RethinkDB, Supabase has no client-side storage or replication feature and therefore is not offline first.\nCouchDB\n\n  \n\n\nApache CouchDB is a server-side, document-oriented database that is mostly known for its multi-master replication feature. Instead of having a master-slave replication, with CouchDB you can run replication in any constellation without having a master server as bottleneck where the server even can go off- and online at any time. This comes with the drawback of having a slow replication with much network overhead.\nCouchDB has a changestream and a query syntax similar to MongoDB.\nPouchDB\n\n  \n\n\n\nPouchDB is a JavaScript database that is compatible with most of the CouchDB API. It has an adapter system that allows you to switch out the underlying storage layer. There are many adapters like for IndexedDB, SQLite, the Filesystem and so on. The main benefit is to be able to replicate data with any CouchDB compatible endpoint.\nBecause of the CouchDB compatibility, PouchDB has to do a lot of overhead in handling the revision tree of document, which is why it can show bad performance for bigger datasets.\nRxDB was originally build around PouchDB until the storage layer was abstracted out in version 10.0.0 so it now allows to use different RxStorage implementations. PouchDB has some performance issues because of how it has to store the document revision tree to stay compatible with the CouchDB API.\nCouchbase\nCouchbase (originally known as Membase) is another NoSQL document database made for realtime applications.\nIt uses the N1QL query language which is more SQL like compared to other NoSQL query languages. In theory you can achieve replication of a Couchbase with a PouchDB database, but this has shown to be not that easy.\nCloudant\nCloudant is a cloud-based service that is based on CouchDB and has mostly the same features.\nIt was originally designed for cloud computing where data can automatically be distributed between servers. But it can also be used to replicate with frontend PouchDB instances to create scalable web applications.\nIt was bought by IBM in 2014 and since 2018 the Cloudant Shared Plan is retired and migrated to IBM Cloud.\nHoodie\nHoodie is a backend solution that enables offline-first JavaScript frontend development without having to write backend code. Its main goal is to abstract away configuration into simple calls to the Hoodie API.\nIt uses CouchDB in the backend and PouchDB in the frontend to enable offline-first capabilities.\nThe last commit for hoodie was one year ago and the website (hood.ie) is offline which indicates it is not an active project anymore.\nLokiJS\nLokiJS is a JavaScript embeddable, in-memory database. And because everything is handled in-memory, LokiJS has awesome performance when mutating or querying data. You can still persist to a permanent storage (IndexedDB, Filesystem etc.) with one of the provided storage adapters. The persistence happens after a timeout is reached after a write, or before the JavaScript process exits. This also means you could loose data when the JavaScript process exits ungracefully like when the power of the device is shut down or the browser crashes.\nWhile the project is not that active anymore, it is more finished than unmaintained.\nRxDB supports using LokiJS as RxStorage.\nGundb\nGUN is a JavaScript graph database. While having many features, the decentralized replication is the main unique selling point. You can replicate data Peer-to-Peer without any centralized backend server. GUN has several other features that are useful on top of that, like encryption and authentication.\nWhile testing it was really hard to get basic things running. GUN is open source, but because of how the source code is written, it is very difficult to understand what is going wrong.\nsql.js\nsql.js is a javascript library to run SQLite on the web. It uses a virtual database file stored in memory and does not have any persistence. All data is lost once the JavaScript process exits. sql.js is created by compiling SQLite to WebAssembly so it has about the same features as SQLite. For older browsers there is a JavaScript fallback.\nabsurd-sQL\nAbsurd-sql is a project that implements an IndexedDB-based persistence for sql.js. Instead of directly writing data into the IndexedDB, it treats IndexedDB like a disk and stores data in blocks there which shows to have a much better performance, mostly because of how performance expensive IndexedDB transactions are.\nNeDB\nNeDB was a embedded persistent or in-memory database for Node.js, nw.js, Electron and browsers.\nIt is document-oriented and had the same query syntax as MongoDB. \nLike LokiJS it has persistence adapters for IndexedDB etc. to persist the database state on the disc.\nThe last commit to NeDB was in 2016.\nDexie.js\nDexie.js is a minimalistic wrapper for IndexedDB. While providing a better API than plain IndexedDB, Dexie also improves performance by batching transactions and other optimizations. It also adds additional non-IndexedDB features like observable queries or multi tab support or react hooks.\nCompared to RxDB, Dexie.js does not support complex (MongoDB-like) queries and requires a lot of fiddling when a document range of a specific index must be fetched.\nDexie.js is used by Whatsapp Web, Microsoft To Do and Github Desktop.\nRxDB supports using Dexie.js as RxStorage which enhances IndexedDB with RxDB features like MongoDB-like queries etc.\nLowDB\nLowDB is a small, local JSON database powered by the Lodash library. It is designed to be simple, easy to use, and straightforward. LowDB allows you to perform native JavaScript queries and persist data in a flat JSON file. Written in TypeScript, it's particularly well-suited for small projects, prototyping, or when you need a lightweight, file-based database.\nAs an alternative to LowDB, RxDB offers real-time reactivity, allowing developers to subscribe to database changes, a feature not natively available in LowDB. Additionally, RxDB provides robust query capabilities, including the ability to subscribe to query results for automatic UI updates. These features make RxDB a strong alternative to LowDB for more complex and dynamic applications.\nMongoDB Realm\nOriginally Realm was a mobile database for Android and iOS. Later they added support for other languages and runtimes, also for JavaScript. \nIt was meant as replacement for SQLite but is more like an object store than a full SQL database.\nIn 2019 MongoDB bought Realm and changed the projects focus.\nNow Realm is made for replication with the MongoDB Realm Sync based on the MongoDB Atlas Cloud platform. This tight coupling to the MongoDB cloud service is a big downside for most use cases.\nApollo\nThe Apollo GraphQL platform is made to transfer data between a server to UI applications over GraphQL endpoints. It contains several tools like GraphQL clients in different languages or libraries to create GraphQL endpoints.\nWhile it is has different caching features for offline usage, compared to RxDB it is not fully offline first because caching alone does not mean your application is fully usable when the user is offline.\nRead further\n\nOffline First Database Comparison\nhttps://jaredforsyth.com/tags/local-first/\n\n"},"react-native-database.html":{"url":"react-native-database.html","title":"React Native Database","keywords":"","body":"React Native Database\nReact Native provides a cross-platform JavaScript runtime that runs on different operating systems like Android, iOS, Windows and others. Mostly it is used to create hybrid Apps that run on mobile devices at Android (google) and iOS (apple).\nIn difference to the JavaScript runtime of browsers, React Native does not support all HTML5 APIs and so it is not possible to use browser storage possibilities like localstorage, cookies, WebSQL or IndexedDB.\nInstead a different storage solution must be chosen that does not come directly with React Native itself but has to be installed as a library or plugin.\nNOTICE: You are reading this inside of the RxDB documentation, so everything might be opinionated.\n\n  \n\n\nDatabase Solutions for React-Native\nThere are multiple database solutions that can be used with React Native. While I would recommend to use RxDB for most use cases, it is still helpful to learn about other alternatives.\nAsyncStorage\nAsyncStorage is a key->value storage solution that works similar to the browsers localstorage API. The big difference is that access to the AsyncStorage is not a blocking operation but instead everything is Promise based. This is a big benefit because long running writes and reads will not block your JavaScript process which would cause a laggy user interface.\n/**\n * Because it is Promise-based,\n * you have to 'await' the call to getItem()\n */\nawait setItem('myKey', 'myValue');\nconst value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey');\n\nAsyncStorage was originally included in React Native itself. But it was deprecated by the React Native Team which recommends to use a community based package instead. There is a community fork of AsyncStorage that is actively maintained and open source.\nAsyncStorage is fine when only a small amount of data needs to be stored and when no query capabilities besides the key-access are required. Complex queries or features are not supported which makes AsyncStorage not suitable for anything more then storing simple user settings data.\nSQLite\nSQLite is a SQL based relational database written in C that was crafted to be embed inside of applications. Operations are written in the SQL query language and SQLite generally follows the PostgreSQL syntax.\nTo use SQLite in React Native, you first have to include the SQLite library itself as a plugin. There a different project out there that can be used, but I would recommend to use the react-native-quick-sqlite project.\nFirst you have to install the library into your React Native project via npm install react-native-quick-sqlite.\nIn your code you can then import the library and create a database connection:\nimport {open} from 'react-native-quick-sqlite';\nconst db = open('myDb.sqlite');\n\nNotice that SQLite is a file based database where all data is stored directly in the filesystem of the OS. Therefore to create a connection, you have to provide a filename.\nWith the open connection you can then run SQL queries:\nlet { rows } = db.execute('SELECT somevalue FROM sometable');\n\nIf that does not work for you, you might want to try the react-native-sqlite-storage project instead which is also very popular.\nThe downside of SQLite is that it is lacking many features that are handful when using a database together with an UI based application. For example it is not possible to observe queries or document fields.\nAlso there is no replication method. This makes SQLite a good solution when you want to solely store data on the client, but not when you want to sync data with a server or other clients.\nPouchDB\n\n  \n\n\nPouchDB is a JavaScript NoSQL database that follows the API of the Apache CouchDB server database.\nThe core feature of PouchDB is the ability to do a two-way replication with any CouchDB compliant endpoint.\nWhile PouchDB is pretty mature, it has some drawbacks that blocks it from being used in a client-side React Native application. For example it has to store all documents states over time which is required to replicate with CouchDB. Also it is not easily possible to fully purge documents and so it will fill up disc space over time. A big problem is also that PouchDB is not really maintained and major bugs like wrong query results are not fixed anymore. The performance of PouchDB is a general bottleneck which is caused by how it has to store and fetch documents while being compliant to CouchDB. The only real reason to use PouchDB in React Native, is when you want to replicate with a CouchDB or Couchbase server.\nBecause PouchDB is based on an adapter system for storage, there are two options to use it with React Native:\n\nEither use the pouchdb-adapter-react-native-sqlite adapter\nor the pouchdb-adapter-asyncstorage adapter.\n\nBecause the asyncstorage adapter is no longer maintained, it is recommended to use the native-sqlite adapter:\nFirst you have to install the adapter and other dependencies via npm install pouchdb-adapter-react-native-sqlite react-native-quick-sqlite react-native-quick-websql.\nThen you have to craft a custom PouchDB class that combines these plugins:\nimport 'react-native-get-random-values';\nimport PouchDB from 'pouchdb-core';\nimport HttpPouch from 'pouchdb-adapter-http';\nimport replication from 'pouchdb-replication';\nimport mapreduce from 'pouchdb-mapreduce';\nimport SQLiteAdapterFactory from 'pouchdb-adapter-react-native-sqlite';\nimport WebSQLite from 'react-native-quick-websql';\n\nconst SQLiteAdapter = SQLiteAdapterFactory(WebSQLite);\nexport default PouchDB.plugin(HttpPouch)\n  .plugin(replication)\n  .plugin(mapreduce)\n  .plugin(SQLiteAdapter);\n\nThis can then be used to create a PouchDB database instance which can store and query documents:\nconst db = new PouchDB('mydb.db', {\n  adapter: 'react-native-sqlite'\n});\n\nRxDB\n\n  \n\n\nRxDB is an offline-first, NoSQL-database for JavaScript applications. It is reactive which means that you can not only query the current state, but subscribe to all state changes like the result of a query or even a single field of a document. This is great for UI-based realtime applications in a way that makes it easy to develop realtime applications like what you need in React Native.\nThere are multiple ways to use RxDB in React Native:\n\nUse the memory RxStorage that stores the data inside of the JavaScript memory without persistence\nUse the LokiJS RxStorage with the react-native-lokijs plugin\nUse the PouchDB RxStorage with the SQLite plugin mentioned above.\nUse the SQLite RxStorage with the react-native-quick-sqlite plugin.\n\nIt is recommended to use the SQLite RxStorage because it has the best performance and is the easiest to set up. However it is part of the Premium Plugins which must be purchased, so to try out RxDB with React Native, you might want to use one of the other three options.\nFirst you have to install all dependencies via npm install rxdb rxjs rxdb-premium react-native-quick-sqlite.\nThen you can assemble the RxStorage and create a database with it:\nimport {\n    createRxDatabase\n} from 'rxdb';\nimport {\n    getRxStorageSQLite,\n    getSQLiteBasicsQuickSQLite\n} from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-sqlite';\nimport { open } from 'react-native-quick-sqlite';\n\n// create database\nconst myRxDatabase = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'exampledb',\n    multiInstance: false, //  {/* ... */});\n\nUsing the SQLite RxStorage is pretty fast, which is shown in the performance comparison.\nTo learn more about using RxDB with React Native, you might want to check out this example project.\nWatermelonDB\nWatermelonDB is a reactive and asynchronous database for React and React Native apps. It is based on SQLite in React Native and LokiJS when it is used in the browser. It supports schemas, observable queries, migrations and relations.\nThe schema layout is handled by TypeScript decorators and looks like this:\nclass Post extends Model {\n  @field('name') name;\n  @field('body') body;\n  @children('comments') comments;\n\n  // a relation to another table\n  @relation('users', 'author_id') author;\n}\n\nWatermelonDB also supports replication but the sync protocol is pretty complex because on how it resolves conflicts. I recommend to watch this video to learn how the replication works.\nAccording to the roadmap, despite being essentially feature-complete, WatermelonDB is still on the 0.xx version and intends to switch to a 1.x.x version as once it reaches a long-term stable API.\nFirebase / Firestore\n\n  \n\n\nFirestore is a cloud based database technology that stores data on clients devices and replicates it with the Firebase cloud service that is run by google. It has many features like observability and authentication.\nThe main feature lacking is the non-complete offline first support because clients cannot start the application while being offline because then the authentication does not work. After they are authenticated, being offline is no longer a problem.\nAlso using firestore creates a vendor lock-in because it is not possible to replicate with a custom self hosted backend.\nTo get started with Firestore in React Native, it is recommended to use the React Native Firebase open-source project.\n\nFollow up\n\nCheck out the RxDB React Native example\nIf you haven't done so yet, you should start learning about RxDB with the Quickstart Tutorial.\nThere is a followup list of other client side database alternatives that might work with React Native.\n\n"},"capacitor-database.html":{"url":"capacitor-database.html","title":"Capacitor Database","keywords":"","body":"Capacitor Database\nCapacitor is an open source native JavaScript runtime to build Web based Native apps. You can use it to create cross-platform iOS, Android, and Progressive Web Apps with the web technologies JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.\nIt is developed by the Ionic Team and provides a great alternative to create hybrid apps. Compared to React Native, Capacitor is more Web-Like because the JavaScript runtime supports most Web APIs like IndexedDB, fetch,  and so on.\nTo read and write persistent data in Capacitor, there are multiple solutions which are shown in the following.\nNOTICE: You are reading this inside of the RxDB documentation, so everything might be opinionated.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nDatabase Solutions for Capacitor\nPreferences API\nCapacitor comes with a native Preferences API which is a simple, persistent key->value store for lightweight data, similar to the browsers localstorage or React Native AsyncStorage.\nTo use it, you first have to install it from npm npm install @capacitor/preferences and then you can import it and write/read data.\nNotice that all calls to the preferences API are asynchronous so they return a Promise that must be await-ed.\nimport { Preferences } from '@capacitor/preferences';\n\n\n// write\nawait Preferences.set({\n  key: 'foo',\n  value: 'baar',\n});\n\n// read\nconst { value } = await Preferences.get({ key: 'foo' }); // > 'bar'\n\n// delete\nawait Preferences.remove({ key: 'foo' });\n\nThe preferences API is good when only a small amount of data needs to be stored and when no query capabilities besides the key access are required. Complex queries or other features like indexes or replication are not supported which makes the preferences API not suitable for anything more then storing simple data like user settings.\nLocalstorage/IndexedDB/WebSQL\nSince Capacitor apps run in a web view, Web APIs like IndexedDB, Localstorage and WebSQL are available. But the default browser behavior is to clean up these storages regularly when they are not in use for a long time or the device is low on space. Therefore you cannot 100% rely on the persistence of the stored data and your application needs to expect that the data will be lost eventually.\nStoring data in these storages can be done in browsers, because there is no other option. But in Capacitor iOS and Android, you should not rely on these.\nSQLite\nSQLite is a SQL based relational database written in C that was crafted to be embed inside of applications. Operations are written in the SQL query language and SQLite generally follows the PostgreSQL syntax.\nTo use SQLite in Capacitor, there are three options:\n\nThe @capacitor-community/sqlite package\nThe cordova-sqlite-storage package\nThe non-free Ionic Secure Storage which comes at 999$ per month.\n\nIt is recommended to use the @capacitor-community/sqlite because it has the best maintenance and is open source. Install it first npm install --save @capacitor-community/sqlite and then set the storage location for iOS apps:\n{\n    \"plugins\": {\n        \"CapacitorSQLite\": {\n            \"iosDatabaseLocation\": \"Library/CapacitorDatabase\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNow you can create a database connection and use the SQLite database.\nimport { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';\nimport { CapacitorSQLite, SQLiteDBConnection, SQLiteConnection, capSQLiteSet,\n         capSQLiteChanges, capSQLiteValues, capEchoResult, capSQLiteResult,\n         capNCDatabasePathResult } from '@capacitor-community/sqlite';\n\nconst sqlite = new SQLiteConnection(CapacitorSQLite);\nconst database: SQLiteDBConnection = await this.sqlite.createConnection(databaseName, encrypted, mode, version, readOnly);\nlet { rows } = database.query('SELECT somevalue FROM sometable');\n\nThe downside of SQLite is that it is lacking many features that are handful when using a database together with an UI based application like your Capacitor app. For example it is not possible to observe queries or document fields. Also there is no realtime replication feature, you can only import json files. This makes SQLite a good solution when you just want to store data on the client, but when you want to sync data with a server or other clients or create big complex realtime applications, you have to use something else.\nRxDB\n\n  \n\n\n\nRxDB is an offline first, NoSQL database for JavaScript Applications like hybrid apps. Because it is reactive, you can subscribe to all state changes like the result of a query or even a single field of a document. This is great for UI-based realtime applications in a way that makes it easy to develop realtime applications like what you need in Capacitor.\nBecause RxDB is made for Web applications, most of the available RxStorage plugins can be used to store and query data in a Capacitor app. However it is recommended to use the SQLite RxStorage because it stores the data on the filesystem of the device, not in the JavaScript runtime (like IndexedDB). Storing data on the filesystem ensures it is persistent and will not be cleaned up by any process. Also the performance of SQLite is much faster compared to IndexedDB, because SQLite does not have to go through a browsers permission layers. For the SQLite binding you should use the @capacitor-community/sqlite package.\nBecause the SQLite RxStorage is part of the Premium Plugins which must be purchased, it is recommended to use the Dexie.js RxStorage while testing and prototyping your Capacitor app.\nTo use the SQLite RxStorage in Capacitor you have to install all dependencies via npm install rxdb rxjs rxdb-premium @capacitor-community/sqlite.\nFor iOS apps you should add a database location in your Capacitor settings:\n{\n    \"plugins\": {\n        \"CapacitorSQLite\": {\n            \"iosDatabaseLocation\": \"Library/CapacitorDatabase\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThen you can assemble the RxStorage and create a database with it:\nimport {\n    createRxDatabase\n} from 'rxdb';\nimport {\n    getRxStorageSQLite,\n    getSQLiteBasicsCapacitor\n} from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-sqlite';\nimport {\n    CapacitorSQLite,\n    SQLiteConnection\n} from '@capacitor-community/sqlite';\nimport { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';\nconst sqlite = new SQLiteConnection(CapacitorSQLite);\n\n// create database\nconst myRxDatabase = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'exampledb',\n    storage: getRxStorageSQLite({\n        sqliteBasics: getSQLiteBasicsCapacitor(sqlite, Capacitor)\n    })\n});\n\n// create collections\nconst collections = await myRxDatabase.addCollections({\n    humans: {\n        /* ... */\n    }\n});\n\n// insert document\nawait collections.humans.insert({id: 'foo', name: 'bar'});\n\n// run a query\nconst result = await collections.humans.find({\n    selector: {\n        name: 'bar'\n    }\n}).exec();\n\n// observe a query\nawait collections.humans.find({\n    selector: {\n        name: 'bar'\n    }\n}).$.subscribe(result => {/* ... */});\n\nFollow up\n\nIf you haven't done yet, you should start learning about RxDB with the Quickstart Tutorial.\nThere is a followup list of other client side database alternatives.\n\n"},"electron-database.html":{"url":"electron-database.html","title":"Electron Database","keywords":"","body":"Electron Database\nElectron (aka Electron.js) is a framework developed by github which is designed to create desktop applications with the Web technology stack consisting of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\nBecause the desktop application runs on the clients device, it is suitable to use a database that can store and query data locally. This allows to create so called offline first apps that even work when to user has no internet connection.\nNOTICE: You are reading this inside of the RxDB documentation, so everything might be opinionated.\n\n  \n\n\nDatabases for Electron\nAn Electron runtime can be divided in two parts:\n\nThe \"main\" process which is a Node.js JavaScript process that runs without a UI in the background.\nOne or multiple \"renderer\" processes that consist of a Chrome browser engine and runs the user interface. Each renderer process represents one \"browser tab\".\n\nThis is important to understand because choosing the right database depends on your use case and on which of these JavaScript runtimes you want to keep the data.\nServer Side Databases\nBecause Electron runs on a desktop computer, you might think that it should be possible to use a common \"server\" database like MySQL, PostgreSQL or MongoDB. In theory you could ship the correct database server binaries with your electron application and start a process on the clients device which exposes a port to the database that can be consumed by Electron. In practice this is not a viable way to go because shipping the correct binaries and opening ports is way to complicated and troublesome. Instead you should use a database that can be bundled and run inside of Electron, either in the main or in the renderer process.\nLocalstorage/IndexedDB/WebSQL\nBecause Electron uses a common Chrome web browser in the renderer process, you can access the common Web Storage APIs like Localstorage, IndexedDB and WebSQL. This is easy to setup and storing small sets of data can be achieved in a short span of time. \nBut as soon as your application goes beyond a simple TODO-app, there are multiple obstacles that come in your way. One thing is the bad multi-tab support. If you have more then one renderer process, it becomes hard to manage database writes between them. Each browser tab could modify the database state while the others do not know of the changes and keep an outdated UI.\nAnother thing is performance. IndexedDB is slow mostly because it has to go through layers of browser security and abstractions. Storing and querying much data might become your performance bottleneck. Localstorage and WebSQL are even slower by the way.\nUsing the Web Storage APIs is generally only recommend when you know for sure that there will be always only one rendering process and performance is not that relevant.\nSQLite\nSQLite is a SQL based relational database written in the C programming language that was crafted to be embed inside of applications and stores data locally. Operations are written in the SQL query language similar to the PostgreSQL syntax.\nUsing SQLite in Electron is not possible in the renderer process, only in the main process. To communicate data operations between your main and your renderer processes, you have to use either @electron/remote (not recommended) or the ipcRenderer (recommended). So you start up SQLite in your main process and whenever you want to read or write data, you send the SQL queries to the main process and retrieve the result back as JSON data.\nTo install SQLite, use the SQLite3 package which is a native Node.js module. Also you need the @electron/rebuild package to rebuild the SQLite module against the currently installed Electron version.\nInstall them with npm install sqlite3 @electron/rebuild.\nThen you can rebuild SQLite with ./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild  -f -w sqlite3\nIn the JavaScript code of your main process you can now create a database:\nconst sqlite3 = require('sqlite3');\nconst db = new sqlite3.Database('/path/to/database/file.db');\n// create a table and insert a row\ndb.serialize(() => {\n  db.run(\"CREATE TABLE Users (name, lastName)\");\n  db.run(\"INSERT INTO Users VALUES (?, ?)\", ['foo', 'bar']);\n});\n\nAlso you have to set up the ipcRenderer so that message from the renderer process are handled:\nipcMain.handle('db-query', async (event, sqlQuery) => {\n  return new Promise(res => {\n      db.all(sqlQuery, (err, rows) => {\n        res(rows);\n      });\n  });\n});\n\nIn your renderer process you can now call the ipcHandler and fetch data from SQLite:\nconst rows = await ipcRenderer.invoke('db-query', \"SELECT * FROM Users\");\n\nThe downside of SQLite is that it is lacking many features that are handful when using a database together with UI based applications. It is not possible to observe queries or document fields and there is no replication method to sync data with a server. This makes SQLite a good solution when you just want to store data on the client, but it is not suitable for more complex operations like two-way replication, encryption, compression and so on. Also developer helpers like TypeScript type safety are totally out of reach.\nRxDB\n\n  \n\n\n\nRxDB is a NoSQL database for JavaScript applications. It has manny features that come in handy when RxDB is used with UI based applications like you Electron app. For example it is able to subscribe to query results of single fields of document. It has encryption and compression features and most important it has a battle tested replication plugin that can be used to do a realtime sync with your backend.\nBecause of the flexible storage layer of RxDB, there are many options on how to use it with Electron:\n\nThe memory RxStorage that stores the data inside of the JavaScript memory without persistence\nThe SQLite RxStorage\nThe PouchDB RxStorage with the SQLite adapter mentioned above.\nThe IndexedDB RxStorage\nThe Dexie.js RxStorage\n\nIt is recommended to use the SQLite RxStorage because it has the best performance and is the easiest to set up. However it is part of the Premium Plugins which must be purchased, so to try out RxDB with Electron, you might want to use one of the other options. To start with RxDB, I would recommend to use the Dexie.js RxStorage in the renderer processes. Because RxDB is able to broadcast the database state between browser tabs, having multiple renderer processes is not a problem like it would be when you use plain IndexedDB without RxDB.\nIn production you would always run the RxStorage in the main process with the RxStorage Electron IpcRenderer & IpcMain plugins.\nFirst you have to install all dependencies via npm install rxdb rxjs.\nThen you can assemble the RxStorage and create a database with it:\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb';\nimport { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';\n\n// create database\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'exampledb',\n    storage: getRxStorageDexie()\n});\n\n// create collections\nconst collections = await myRxDatabase.addCollections({\n    humans: {\n        /* ... */\n    }\n});\n\n// insert document\nawait collections.humans.insert({id: 'foo', name: 'bar'});\n\n// run a query\nconst result = await collections.humans.find({\n    selector: {\n        name: 'bar'\n    }\n}).exec();\n\n// observe a query\nawait collections.humans.find({\n    selector: {\n        name: 'bar'\n    }\n}).$.subscribe(result => {/* ... */});\n\nFor having a better performance in the renderer tab, you can later switch to the IndexedDB RxStorage.

As Angular applications often require persistent storage and efficient data handling, choosing the right database solution is crucial. One such solution is RxDB, a reactive JavaScript database for the browser, node.js, and mobile devices. In this article, we will explore the integration of RxDB into an Angular application and examine its various features and techniques.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nAngular Web Applications\nAngular is a powerful JavaScript framework developed and maintained by Google. It enables developers to build single-page applications (SPAs) with a modular and component-based approach. Angular provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for creating dynamic and responsive web applications.\nImportance of Databases in Angular Applications\nDatabases play a vital role in Angular applications by providing a structured and efficient way to store, retrieve, and manage data. Whether it's handling user authentication, caching data, or persisting application state, a robust database solution is essential for ensuring optimal performance and user experience.\nIntroducing RxDB as a Database Solution\nRxDB stands for Reactive Database and is built on the principles of reactive programming. It combines the best features of NoSQL databases with the power of reactive programming to provide a scalable and efficient database solution. RxDB offers seamless integration with Angular applications and brings several unique features that make it an attractive choice for developers.\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started with RxDB\nTo begin our journey with RxDB, let's understand its key concepts and features.\nWhat is RxDB?\nRxDB is a client-side database that follows the principles of reactive programming. It is built on top of IndexedDB, the native browser database, and leverages the RxJS library for reactive data handling. RxDB provides a simple and intuitive API for managing data and offers features like data replication, multi-tab support, and efficient query handling.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nReactive Data Handling\nAt the core of RxDB is the concept of reactive data handling. RxDB leverages observables and reactive streams to enable real-time updates and data synchronization. With RxDB, you can easily subscribe to data changes and react to them in a reactive and efficient manner.\n\n  \n\n\nOffline-First Approach\nOne of the standout features of RxDB is its offline-first approach.

In this article, we will explore why storing data in the frontend is beneficial, the limitations of SQL databases in the frontend, and how RxDB addresses these challenges to become an excellent choice for frontend data storage.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nWhy you might want to store data in the frontend\nOffline accessibility\nOne compelling reason to store data in the frontend is to enable offline accessibility. By leveraging a frontend database, applications can cache essential data locally, allowing users to continue using the application even when an internet connection is unavailable. This feature is particularly useful for mobile applications or web apps with limited or intermittent connectivity.\nCaching\nFrontend databases also serve as efficient caching mechanisms. By storing frequently accessed data locally, applications can minimize network requests and reduce latency, resulting in faster and more responsive user experiences. Caching is particularly beneficial for applications that heavily rely on remote data or perform computationally intensive operations.\nDecreased initial application start time\nStoring data in the frontend decreases the initial application start time because the data is already present locally. By eliminating the need to fetch data from a server during startup, applications can quickly render the UI and provide users with an immediate interactive experience. This is especially advantageous for applications with large datasets or complex data retrieval processes.\nPassword encryption for local data\nSecurity is a crucial aspect of data storage. With a frontend database, developers can encrypt sensitive local data, such as user credentials or personal information, using encryption algorithms. This ensures that even if the device is compromised, the data remains securely stored and protected.\nLocal database for state management\nFrontend databases provide an alternative to traditional state management libraries like Redux or NgRx. By utilizing a local database, developers can store and manage application state directly in the frontend, eliminating the need for additional libraries. This approach simplifies the codebase, reduces complexity, and provides a more straightforward data flow within the application.\nLow-latency local queries\nFrontend databases enable low-latency queries that run entirely on the client's device. Instead of relying on server round-trips for each query, the database executes queries locally, resulting in faster response times. This is particularly beneficial for applications that require real-time updates or frequent data retrieval.\n\n  \n\n\n\nBuilding realtime applications with local data\nRealtime applications often require immediate updates based on data changes. By storing data locally and utilizing a frontend database, developers can build realtime applications more easily. The database can observe data changes and automatically update the UI, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.\nEasier integration with JavaScript frameworks\nFrontend databases, including RxDB, are designed to integrate seamlessly with popular JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, React.js, Vue.js, and Svelte. These databases offer well-defined APIs and support that align with the specific requirements of these frameworks, enabling developers to leverage the full potential of the frontend database within their preferred development environment.\nSimplified replication of database state\nReplicating database state between the frontend and backend can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex REST routes. Frontend databases, however, provide simpler mechanisms for replicating database state. They offer intuitive replication algorithms that facilitate data synchronization between the frontend and backend, reducing the complexity and potential pitfalls associated with complex REST-based replication.\nImproved scalability\nFrontend databases offer improved scalability compared to traditional SQL databases. By leveraging the computational capabilities of client devices, the burden on server resources is reduced. Queries and operations are performed locally, minimizing the need for server round-trips and enabling applications to scale more efficiently.\nWhy SQL databases are not a good fit for the frontend\nWhile SQL databases excel in server-side scenarios, they pose limitations when used on the frontend. Here are some reasons why SQL databases are not well-suited for frontend applications:\nPush/Pull based vs. reactive\nSQL databases typically rely on a push/pull model, where the server pushes data to the client upon request. This approach is not inherently reactive, as it requires explicit requests for data updates. In contrast, frontend applications often require reactive data flows, where changes in data trigger automatic updates in the UI. Frontend databases, like RxDB, provide reactive capabilities that seamlessly integrate with the dynamic nature of frontend development.\nInitialization time and performance\nSQL databases designed for server-side usage tend to have larger build sizes and initialization times, making them less efficient for browser-based applications. Frontend databases, on the other hand, directly leverage browser APIs like IndexedDB, OPFS, and WebWorker, resulting in leaner builds and faster initialization times. Often the queries are such fast, that it is not even necessary to implement a loading spinner.\n\n  \n\n\nBuild size considerations\nServer-side SQL databases typically come with a significant build size, which can be impractical for browser applications where code size optimization is crucial. Frontend databases, on the other hand, are specifically designed to operate within the constraints of browser environments, ensuring efficient resource utilization and smaller build sizes.\nFor example the SQLite Webassembly file alone has a size of over 0.8 Megabyte with an additional 0.2 Megabyte in JavaScript code for connection.\nWhy RxDB is a good fit for the frontend\nRxDB is a powerful frontend JavaScript database that addresses the limitations of SQL databases and provides an optimal solution for frontend data storage.

RxDB combines the simplicity of JavaScript's document-based database model with the reactive programming paradigm, enabling developers to build real-time and offline-first applications with ease.\nGetting Started with RxDB\nTo understand how RxDB can be utilized in a Flutter application, let's explore its core features and advantages.\nWhat is RxDB?\nRxDB is a client-side database built on top of IndexedDB, which is a low-level browser-based database API. It provides a simple and intuitive API for performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on documents. RxDB's underlying architecture allows for efficient handling of data synchronization between multiple clients and servers.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\nReactive Data Handling\nOne of the key strengths of RxDB is its reactive data handling. It leverages the power of Observables, a concept from reactive programming, to automatically update the UI in response to data changes. With RxDB, developers can define queries and subscribe to their results, ensuring that the UI is always in sync with the database.\nOffline-First Approach\nRxDB follows an offline-first approach, making it ideal for building Flutter applications that need to function even without an internet connection. It allows data to be stored locally and seamlessly synchronizes it with the server when a connection is available. This ensures that users can access and interact with their data regardless of network availability.\nData Replication\nData replication is a critical aspect of building distributed applications. RxDB provides robust replication capabilities that enable synchronization of data between different clients and servers. With its replication plugins, RxDB simplifies the process of setting up real-time data synchronization, ensuring consistency across all connected devices.\nObservable Queries\nRxDB introduces the concept of observable queries, which are queries that automatically update when the underlying data changes. This feature is particularly useful for keeping the UI up to date with the latest data. By subscribing to an observable query, developers can receive real-time updates and reflect them in the user interface without manual intervention.\nRxDB vs. Other Flutter Database Options\nWhen considering database options for Flutter applications, developers often come across alternatives such as SQLite or LokiJS. While these databases have their merits, RxDB offers several advantages over them. RxDB's seamless integration with Flutter, its offline-first approach, reactive data handling, and built-in data replication make it a compelling choice for building feature-rich and scalable Flutter applications.\nUsing RxDB in a Flutter Application\nNow that we understand the core features of RxDB, let's explore how to integrate it into a Flutter application.\nHow RxDB can run in Flutter\nRxDB is written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. To run it in a Flutter application, the flutter_qjs library is used to spawn a QuickJS JavaScript runtime. RxDB itself runs in that runtime and communicates with the flutter dart runtime. To store data persistent, the LokiJS RxStorage is used together with a custom storage adapter that persists the database inside of the shared_preferences data.\nTo use RxDB, you have to create a compatible JavaScript file that creates your RxDatabase and starts some connectors which are used by Flutter to communicate with the JavaScript RxDB database via setFlutterRxDatabaseConnector().\nimport {\n    createRxDatabase\n} from 'rxdb';\nimport {\n    getRxStorageLoki\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-lokijs';\nimport {\n    setFlutterRxDatabaseConnector,\n    getLokijsAdapterFlutter\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/flutter';\n\n// do all database creation stuff in this method.\nasync function createDB(databaseName) {\n    // create the RxDatabase\n    const db = await createRxDatabase({\n        // the database.name is variable so we can change it on the flutter side\n        name: databaseName,\n        storage: getRxStorageLoki({\n            adapter: getLokijsAdapterFlutter()\n        }),\n        multiInstance: false\n    });\n    await db.addCollections({\n        heroes: {\n            schema: {\n                version: 0,\n                primaryKey: 'id',\n                type: 'object',\n                properties: {\n                    id: {\n                        type: 'string',\n                        maxLength: 100\n                    },\n                    name: {\n                        type: 'string',\n                        maxLength: 100\n                    },\n                    color: {\n                        type: 'string',\n                        maxLength: 30\n                    }\n                },\n                indexes: ['name'],\n                required: ['id', 'name', 'color']\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    return db;\n}\n\n// start the connector so that flutter can communicate with the JavaScript process\nsetFlutterRxDatabaseConnector(\n    createDB\n);\n\nBefore you can use the JavaScript code, you have to bundle it into a single .js file. In this example we do that with webpack in a npm script here which bundles everything into the javascript/dist/index.js file.\nTo allow Flutter to access that file during runtime, add it to the assets inside of your pubspec.yaml:\nflutter:\n  assets:\n    - javascript/dist/index.js\n\nAlso you need to install RxDB in your flutter part of the application. First you have to use the rxdb dart package as a flutter dependency. Currently the package is not published at the dart pub.dev. Instead you have to install it from the local filesystem inside of your RxDB npm installation.\n# inside of pubspec.yaml\ndependencies:\n  rxdb:\n    path: path/to/your/node_modules/rxdb/src/plugins/flutter/dart\n\nAfterwards you can import the rxdb library in your dart code and connect to the JavaScript process from there. For reference, check out the lib/main.dart file.\nimport 'package:rxdb/rxdb.dart';\n\n// start the javascript process and connect to the database\nRxDatabase database = await getRxDatabase(\"javascript/dist/index.js\", databaseName);\n\n// get a collection\nRxCollection collection = database.getCollection('heroes');\n\n// insert a document\nRxDocument document = await collection.insert({\n    \"id\": \"zflutter-${DateTime.now()}\",\n    \"name\": nameController.text,\n    \"color\": colorController.text\n});\n\n// create a query\nRxQuery query = RxDatabaseState.collection.find();\n\n// create list to store query results\nList> documents = [];\n\n// subscribe to a query\nquery.$().listen((results) {\n    setState(() {\n        documents = results;\n    });\n});\n\nDifferent RxStorage layers for RxDB\nRxDB offers multiple storage options, known as RxStorage layers, to store data locally. These options include:\n\nLokiJS RxStorage: LokiJS is an in-memory database that can be used as a storage layer for RxDB. It provides fast and efficient in-memory data management capabilities.\nSQLite RxStorage: SQLite is a popular and widely used embedded database that offers robust storage capabilities. RxDB utilizes SQLite as a storage layer to persist data on the device.\nMemory RxStorage: As the name suggests, Memory RxStorage stores data in memory. While this option does not provide persistence, it can be useful for temporary or cache-based data storage.\nBy choosing the appropriate RxStorage layer based on the specific requirements of the application, developers can optimize performance and storage efficiency.\n\nSynchronizing Data with RxDB between Clients and Servers\nOne of the key strengths of RxDB is its ability to synchronize data between multiple clients and servers seamlessly. Let's explore how this synchronization can be achieved.\nOffline-First Approach\nRxDB's offline-first approach ensures that data can be accessed and modified even when there is no internet connection. Changes made offline are automatically synchronized with the server once a connection is reestablished. This ensures data consistency across all devices, providing a seamless user experience.\nRxDB Replication Plugins\nRxDB provides replication plugins that simplify the process of setting up data synchronization between clients and servers. These plugins offer various synchronization strategies, such as one-way replication, two-way replication, and conflict resolution mechanisms. By configuring the appropriate replication plugin, developers can easily establish real-time data synchronization in their Flutter applications.\nAdvanced RxDB Features and Techniques\nRxDB offers a range of advanced features and techniques that enhance its functionality and performance. Let's explore a few of these features:\nIndexing and Performance Optimization\nIndexing is a technique used to optimize query performance by creating indexes on specific fields. RxDB allows developers to define indexes on document fields, improving the efficiency of queries and data retrieval.\nEncryption of Local Data\nTo ensure data privacy and security, RxDB supports encryption of local data. By encrypting the data stored on the device, developers can protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access.\nChange Streams and Event Handling\nRxDB provides change streams, which emit events whenever data changes occur.

It allows developers to store key-value pairs directly in a user's browser. In this article, we will explore the various aspects of the localStorage API, its advantages, limitations, and alternative storage options available for modern applications.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\nWhat is the localStorage API?\nThe localStorage API is a built-in feature of web browsers that enables web developers to store small amounts of data persistently on a user's device. It operates on a simple key-value basis, allowing developers to save strings, numbers, and other simple data types. This data remains available even after the user closes the browser or navigates away from the page. The API provides a convenient way to maintain state and store user preferences without relying on server-side storage.\nExploring localStorage Methods: A Practical Example\nLet's dive into some hands-on code examples to better understand how to leverage the power of localStorage. The API offers several methods for interaction, including setItem, getItem, removeItem, and clear. Consider the following code snippet:\n// Storing data using setItem\nlocalStorage.setItem('username', 'john_doe');\n\n// Retrieving data using getItem\nconst storedUsername = localStorage.getItem('username');\n\n// Removing data using removeItem\nlocalStorage.removeItem('username');\n\n// Clearing all data\nlocalStorage.clear();\n\nStoring Complex Data with JSON Serialization\nWhile localStorage excels at handling simple key-value pairs, it also supports more intricate data storage through JSON serialization. By utilizing JSON.stringify and JSON.parse, you can store and retrieve structured data like objects and arrays. Here's an example of storing a document:\nconst user = {\n  name: 'Alice',\n  age: 30,\n  email: 'alice@example.com'\n};\n\n// Storing a user object\nlocalStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));\n\n// Retrieving and parsing the user object\nconst storedUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));\n\nUnderstanding the Limitations of localStorage\nDespite its convenience, localStorage does come with a set of limitations that developers should be aware of:\n\nNon-Async Blocking API: One significant drawback is that localStorage operates as a non-async blocking API. This means that any operations performed on localStorage can potentially block the main thread, leading to slower application performance and a less responsive user experience.\nLimited Data Structure: Unlike more advanced databases, localStorage is limited to a simple key-value store. This restriction makes it unsuitable for storing complex data structures or managing relationships between data elements.\nStringification Overhead: Storing JSON data in localStorage requires stringifying the data before storage and parsing it when retrieved. This process introduces performance overhead, potentially slowing down operations by up to 10 times.\nLack of Indexing: localStorage lacks indexing capabilities, making it challenging to perform efficient searches or iterate over data based on specific criteria. This limitation can hinder applications that rely on complex data retrieval.\nTab Blocking: In a multi-tab environment, one tab's localStorage operations can impact the performance of other tabs by monopolizing CPU resources. You can reproduce this behavior by opening this test file in two browser windows and trigger localstorage inserts in one of them. You will observe that the indication spinner will stuck in both windows.\nStorage Limit: Browsers typically impose a storage limit of around 5 MiB for each origin's localStorage.\n\nReasons to Still Use localStorage\nIs localStorage Slow?\nContrary to concerns about performance, the localStorage API is surprisingly fast when compared to alternative storage solutions. It excels in handling small key-value assignments efficiently. Due to its simplicity and direct integration with browsers, accessing and modifying localStorage data incur minimal overhead. For scenarios where quick and straightforward data storage is required, localStorage remains a viable option.\nWhen Not to Use localStorage\nWhile localStorage offers convenience, it may not be suitable for every use case. Consider the following situations where alternatives might be more appropriate:\n\nData Must Be Queryable: If your application relies heavily on querying data based on specific criteria, localStorage might not provide the necessary querying capabilities. Complex data retrieval might lead to inefficient code and slow performance.\nBig JSON Documents: Storing large JSON documents in localStorage can consume a significant amount of memory and degrade performance. It's essential to assess the size of the data you intend to store and consider more robust solutions for handling substantial datasets.\nMany Read/Write Operations: Excessive read and write operations on localStorage can lead to performance bottlenecks. Other storage solutions might offer better performance and scalability for applications that require frequent data manipulation.\nLack of Persistence: If your application can function without persistent data across sessions, consider using in-memory data structures like new Map() or new Set(). These options offer speed and efficiency for transient data.\n\nWhat to use instead of localStorage\nlocalStorage vs IndexedDB\nWhile localStorage serves as a reliable storage solution for simpler data needs, it's essential to explore alternatives like IndexedDB when dealing with more complex requirements. IndexedDB is designed to store not only key-value pairs but also JSON documents. Unlike localStorage, which usually has a storage limit of around 5-10MB per domain, IndexedDB can handle significantly larger datasets. IndexDB with its support for indexing facilitates efficient querying, making range queries possible. However, it's worth noting that IndexedDB lacks observability, which is a feature unique to localStorage through the storage event. Also, \ncomplex queries can pose a challenge with IndexedDB, and while its performance is acceptable, it's not exceptional.\n// localStorage can observe chanes with the storage event.\n// This feature is missing in IndexedDB\naddEventListener(\"storage\", (event) => {});\n\nFor those looking to harness the full power of IndexedDB with added capabilities, using wrapper libraries like RxDB or Dexie.js is recommended. These libraries augment IndexedDB with features such as complex queries and observability, enhancing its usability for modern applications.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\nFile System API (OPFS)\nAnother intriguing option is the OPFS (File System API). This API provides direct access to an origin-based, sandboxed filesystem which is highly optimized for performance and offers in-place write access to its content.\nOPFS offers impressive performance benefits. However, working with the OPFS API can be complex, and it's only accessible within a WebWorker. To simplify its usage and extend its capabilities, consider using a wrapper library like RxDB's OPFS RxStorage, which builds a comprehensive database on top of the OPFS API. This abstraction allows you to harness the power of the OPFS API without the intricacies of direct usage.\nlocalStorage vs Cookies\nCookies, once a primary method of client-side data storage, have fallen out of favor in modern web development due to their limitations. While they can store data, they are about 100 times slower when compared to the localStorage API. Additionally, cookies are included in the HTTP header, which can impact network performance. As a result, cookies are not recommended for data storage purposes in contemporary web applications.\nlocalStorage vs WebSQL\nWebSQL, despite offering a SQL-based interface for client-side data storage, is a deprecated technology and should be avoided. Its API has been phased out of modern browsers, and it lacks the robustness of alternatives like IndexedDB. Moreover, WebSQL tends to be around 10 times slower than IndexedDB, making it a suboptimal choice for applications that demand efficient data manipulation and retrieval.\nlocalStorage vs sessionStorage\nIn scenarios where data persistence beyond a session is unnecessary, developers often turn to sessionStorage. This storage mechanism retains data only for the duration of a tab or browser session. It survives page reloads and restores, providing a handy solution for temporary data needs. However, it's important to note that sessionStorage is limited in scope and may not suit all use cases.\nAsyncStorage for React Native\nFor React Native developers, the AsyncStorage API is the go-to solution, mirroring the behavior of localStorage but with asynchronous support. Since not all JavaScript runtimes support localStorage, AsyncStorage offers a seamless alternative for data persistence in React Native applications.\nnode-localstorage for Node.js\nBecause native localStorage is absent in Node.js, you will get the error ReferenceError: localStorage is not defined in Node.js or node based runtimes like Next.js. The node-localstorage npm package bridges the gap. This package replicates the browser's localStorage API within the Node.js environment, ensuring consistent and compatible data storage capabilities.\nConclusion: Choosing the Right Storage Solution\nIn the world of modern web development, localStorage serves as a valuable tool for lightweight data storage. Its simplicity and speed make it an excellent choice for small key-value assignments. However, as application complexity grows, developers must assess their storage needs carefully. For scenarios that demand advanced querying, complex data structures, or high-volume operations, alternatives like IndexedDB, wrapper libraries with additional features like RxDB, or platform-specific APIs offer more robust solutions. By understanding the strengths and limitations of various storage options, developers can make informed decisions that pave the way for efficient and scalable applications.\n"},"articles/ionic-database.html":{"url":"articles/ionic-database.html","title":"Ionic Database","keywords":"","body":"Ionic Storage - RxDB as database for hybrid apps\nIn the fast-paced world of mobile app development, hybrid applications have emerged as a versatile solution, offering the best of both worlds - the web and native app experiences.

JSON data is highly compatible with various tools and is human-readable, making it an excellent fit for modern applications. JSON documents offer more flexibility compared to traditional SQL table rows, as they can contain nested data structures. This article introduces RxDB, an open-source, flexible, performant, and battle-tested NoSQL JSON database specifically designed for JavaScript applications.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nWhy Choose a JSON Database?\n\nJavaScript Friendliness: JavaScript, a prevalent language for web development, naturally uses JSON for data representation. Using a JSON database aligns seamlessly with JavaScript's native data format.\n\nCompatibility: JSON is widely supported across different programming languages and platforms. Storing data in JSON format ensures compatibility with a broad range of tools and systems. All modern programming ecosystems have packages to parse, validate and process JSON data.\n\nFlexibility: JSON documents can accommodate complex and nested data structures, allowing developers to store data in a more intuitive and hierarchical manner compared to SQL table rows. Nested data can be just stored in-document instead of having related tables.\n\nHuman-Readable: JSON is easy to read and understand, simplifying debugging and data inspection tasks.\n\n\nStorage and Access Options for JSON Documents\nWhen incorporating JSON documents into your application, you have several storage and access options to consider:\n\nLocal In-App Database with In-Memory Storage: Ideal for lightweight applications or temporary data storage, this option keeps data in memory, ensuring fast read and write operations. However, data is not persisted beyond the current application session, making it suitable for temporary data storage. With RxDB, the memory RxStorage can be utilized to create an in-memory database.\n\nLocal In-App Database with Persistent Storage: Suitable for applications requiring data retention across sessions. Data is stored on the user's device or inside of the Node.js application, offering persistence between application sessions. It balances speed and data retention, making it versatile for various applications. With RxDB, a whole range of persistend storages is available. As example, for browser there is the IndexedDB storage. For server side applications, the Node.js Filesystem storage can be used. There are many more storages for React-Native, Flutter, Capacitors.js and others.\n\nServer Database Connected to the Application: For applications requiring data synchronization and accessibility from multiple processes, a server-based database is the preferred choice. Data is stored on a remote server, facilitating data sharing, synchronization, and accessibility across multiple processes. It's suitable for scenarios requiring centralized data management and enhanced security and backup capabilities on the server. RxDB supports the FoundationDB and MongoDB as a remote database server.\n\n\nCompression Storage for JSON Documents\nCompression storage for JSON documents is made effortless with RxDB's key-compression plugin. This feature enables the efficient storage of compressed document data, reducing storage requirements while maintaining data integrity. Queries on compressed documents remain seamless, ensuring that your application benefits from both space-saving advantages and optimal query performance, making RxDB a compelling choice for managing JSON data efficiently. The compression happens inside of the RxDatabase and does not affect the API usage. The only limitation is that encrypted fields themself cannot be used inside a query.\nSchema Validation and Data Migration on Schema Changes\nStoring JSON documents inside of an application, can cause a problem when the format of the data changes. Instead of having a single server where the data must be migrated, many client devices are out there that have to run a migration.\nWhen your application's schema evolves, RxDB provides migration strategies to facilitate the transition, ensuring data consistency throughout schema updates.\nJSONSchema Validation Plugins: RxDB supports multiple JSONSchema validation plugins, guaranteeing that only valid data is stored in the database. RxDB uses the JsonSchema standardization that you might know from other technologies like OpenAPI (aka Swagger).\n// RxDB Schema example\nconst mySchema = {\n    version: 0,\n    primaryKey: 'id', // \nStore JSON with RxDB in Browser Applications\nRxDB offers versatile storage solutions for browser-based applications:\n\nMultiple Storage Plugins: RxDB supports various storage backends, including IndexedDB, Dexie.js, In-Memory, and Loki.js, catering to a range of browser environments.\n\nObservable Queries: With RxDB, you can create observable queries that work seamlessly across multiple browser tabs, providing real-time updates and synchronization.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nRxDB Database Performance\nCertainly! Let's delve deeper into the performance aspects of RxDB when it comes to working with JSON data.\n\nEfficient Querying: RxDB is engineered for rapid and efficient querying of JSON data. It employs a well-optimized indexing system that allows for lightning-fast retrieval of specific data points within your JSON documents. Whether you're fetching individual values or complex nested structures, RxDB's query performance is designed to keep your application responsive, even when dealing with large datasets.\n\nScalability: As your application grows and your JSON dataset expands, RxDB scales gracefully. Its performance remains consistent, enabling you to handle increasingly larger volumes of data without compromising on speed or responsiveness. This scalability is essential for applications that need to accommodate growing user bases and evolving data needs.\n\nReduced Latency: RxDB's streamlined data access mechanisms significantly reduce latency when working with JSON data. Whether you're reading from the database, making updates, or synchronizing data between clients and servers, RxDB's optimized operations help minimize the delays often associated with data access. Observed queris are optimized with the EventReduce algorithm to provide nearly-instand UI updates on data changes.\n\nRxStorage Layer: Because RxDB allows you to swap out the storage layer. A storage with the most optimal performance can be chosen for each runtime while not touching other database code. Depending on the access patterns, you can pick exactly the storage that is best:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nRxDB in Node.js\nNode.js developers can also benefit from RxDB's capabilities. By integrating RxDB into your Node.js applications, you can harness the power of a NoSQL JSON database to efficiently manage your data on the server-side. RxDB's flexibility, performance, and essential features are equally valuable in server-side development.

This hybrid approach can be advantageous when dealing with complex data relationships while retaining the flexibility of JSON data representation.\nFollow Up\nTo further explore RxDB and get started with using it in your frontend applications, consider the following resources:\n\nRxDB Quickstart: A step-by-step guide to quickly set up RxDB in your project and start leveraging its features.\nRxDB GitHub Repository: The official repository for RxDB, where you can find the code, examples, and community support.\n\nBy embracing RxDB as your JSON database solution, you can tap into the extensive capabilities of JSON data storage. This empowers your applications with offline accessibility, caching, enhanced performance, and effortless data synchronization. RxDB's focus on JavaScript and its robust feature set render it the perfect selection for frontend developers in pursuit of efficient and scalable data storage solutions.\n"},"articles/realtime-database.html":{"url":"articles/realtime-database.html","title":"Realtime Database","keywords":"","body":"What is a realtime database?\nI have been building RxDB, a NoSQL realtime JavaScript database for many years.\nOften people get confused by the word realtime database, because the word realtime is so vaguely defined that it can mean everything and nothing at the same time.\nIn this article we will explore what a realtime database is, and more important, what it is not.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nRealtime as in realtime computing\nWhen \"normal\" developers hear the word \"realtime\", they think of Real-time computing (RTC). Real-time computing is a type of computer processing that guarantees specific response times for tasks or events, crucial in applications like industrial control, automotive systems, and aerospace. It relies on specialized operating systems (RTOS) to ensure predictability and low latency. Hard real-time systems must never miss deadlines, while soft real-time systems can tolerate occasional delays. Real-time responses are often understood to be in the order of milliseconds, and sometimes microseconds.\nConsider the role of real-time computing in car airbags: sensors detect collision force, swiftly process the data, and immediately decide to deploy the airbags within milliseconds. Such rapid action is imperative for safeguarding passengers. Hence, the controlling chip must guarantee a certain response time — it must operate in \"realtime\".\nBut when people talk about realtime databases, especially in the web-development world, they almost never mean realtime, as in realtime computing, they mean something else.\nIn fact, with any programming language that run on end users devices, it is not even possible to built a \"real\" realtime database. A program, like a JavaScript (browser or Node.js) process, can be halted by the operating systems task manager at any time and therefore it will never be able to guarantee specific response times. To build a realtime computing database, you would need a realtime capable operating system.\nRealtime as in realtime replication\nWhen talking about realtime databases, most people refer to realtime, as in realtime replication.\nOften they mean a very specific product which is the Firebase Realtime Database (not the Firestore).\n\n  \n\n\nIn the context of the Firebase Realtime Database, \"realtime\" means that data changes are synchronized and delivered to all connected clients or devices as soon as they occur, typically within milliseconds. This means that when any client updates, adds, or removes data in the database, all other clients that are connected to the same database instance receive those updates instantly, without the need for manual polling or frequent HTTP requests.\nIn short, when replicating data between databases, instead of polling, we use a websocket connection to live-stream all changes between the server and the clients, this is labeled as \"realtime database\". A similar thing can be done with RxDB and the RxDB Replication Plugins.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nRealtime as in realtime applications\nIn the context of realtime client-side applications, \"realtime\" refers to the immediate or near-instantaneous processing and response to events or data inputs. When data changes, the application must directly update to reflect the new data state, without any user interaction or delay. Notice that the change to the data could have come from any source, like a user action, an operation in another browser tab, or even an operation from another device that has been replicated to the client.\n\n  \n\n\nIn contrast to push-pull based databases (e.g., MySQL or MongoDB servers), a realtime database contains features which make it easy to build realtime applications. For example with RxDB you can not only fetch query results once, but instead you can subscribe to a query and directly update the HTML dom tree whenever the query has a new result set:\nawait db.heroes.find({\n  selector: {\n    healthpoints: {\n      $gt: 0\n    }\n  }\n})\n.$ // The $ returns an observable that emits whenever the query's result set changes.\n.subscribe(aliveHeroes => {\n    // Refresh the HTML list each time there are new query results.\n    const newContent = aliveHeroes.map(doc => '' + doc.name + '');\n    document.getElementById('#myList').innerHTML = newContent;\n});\n\n// You can even subscribe to any RxDB document's fields.\nmyDocument.firstName$.subscribe(newName => console.log('name is: ' + newName));\n\nA competent realtime application is engineered to offer feedback or results swiftly, ideally within milliseconds to microseconds. Ideally, a data modification should be processed in under 16 milliseconds (since 1 second divided by 60 frames equals 16.66ms) to ensure users don't perceive any lag from input to visualization. RxDB utilizes the EventReduce algorithm to manage changes more swiftly than 16ms. However, it can never assure fixed response times as a \"realtime computing database\" would.\nFollow Up\n\nDive into the RxDB Quickstart\nDiscover more about the RxDB realtime replication protocol\nJoin the conversation at RxDB Chat\n\n"},"rx-storage-pouchdb.html":{"url":"rx-storage-pouchdb.html","title":"RxStorage PouchDB","keywords":"","body":"RxStorage PouchDB\nThe PouchDB RxStorage is based on the PouchDB database.
